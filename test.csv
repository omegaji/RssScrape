But what comes next on the horizon in terms of the future of mobile technology? To answer this question, research and development initiatives have already started in multiple countries and regions around the globe to work on the next generation in the evolution of mobile:\xa0 6G. Although the 6G vision is still to be defined, it is expected that the next generation of mobile technology will build on the capabilities of more bandwidth, lower latency, additional spectrum and greater reliability, 6G is expected to apply new cognitive, predictive and contextual capabilities to deliver a yet-to-be-imagined level of user experience.</p>\n<p>As such, it is a strategic imperative that North America establish itself as the global leader in the ideas, development, adoption and rapid commercialization of 6G, while continuing to work with global partners in areas like standards leadership to assure a broad marketplace for 6G solutions. ATIS has established the <a href=""https://nextgalliance.org/"">Next G Alliance</a> to provide the foundation for North America to develop a 6G national roadmap and set of research priorities. The goal is that these not only spur development and innovation but ultimately drive economic growth and commercialization success for the entire region. By leveraging the knowledge gained from the development and early deployments of 5G, the North America market is well positioned to advance mobile technology leadership in 6G and beyond.</p>\n<p>The Next G Alliance is a collaborative effort across industry and academia that will encompass the full lifecycle of research and development, manufacturing, standardization, market readiness and commercialization of 6G. It was born out of ATIS’ <a href=""https://www.atis.org/wp-content/uploads/2020/07/Promoting-US-Leadership-on-Path-to-6G.pdf"">Call to Action</a> issued in May 2020 to extend the benefits of 5G commercialization within the U.S. to a 6G world that delivers innovative services and customer experiences beyond network boundaries, physical environments and geographic constraints. The Call to Action identifies a proposed list of core Next G technologies as well as recommendations on government actions to stimulate innovation and development. Building on the Call to Action, the key strategic actions of the Next G Alliance are to:</p>\n<ul>\n<li>Create a 6G national roadmap that will promote a vibrant marketplace for 6G introduction, adoption and commercialization with U.S. innovation in mind</li>\n<li>Develop a set of national priorities that will influence government applied research funding and promote incentivized government actions</li>\n<li>Progress a North American model that promotes development across the full lifecycle of research to realization, aligned with commercialization outcomes</li>\n</ul>\n<p>Who is setting this strategy into action? The Next G Alliance encourages participation across all stakeholders in the mobile industry, including mobility service providers; ICT industry companies; network systems providers, operations and business software providers; start-ups; industry vertical companies as well as other industry association partners. Being a member of the Next G Alliance does not require participants to be a member of ATIS.</p>\n<p>Beyond the enablement of applications that exceed any previous generation of mobile technology, 6G will further change the way data is created, processed and consumed. This may spur new business models, forms of data ownership, and related policies. The Next G Alliance’s work will position a range of entities, including operators, resource brokers, services and application providers as well as trust and security providers to reap the benefits of a 6G economy.</p>\n<p>The path to this future will undoubtedly present new challenges but also the potential for exciting new opportunities for both existing and new participants. The Next G Alliance is seizing a critical opportunity to ensure future generations of mobile technology deliver the maximum benefit to all stakeholders and that North America drives the vision of how we get there.</p>\n<p>&nbsp;</p>\n<p>&nbsp;</p>\n<br /><br /><br /><br /><br /><br />\n<p>The post <a href=""https://www.atis.org/atis-next-g-alliance-sets-direction-for-north-america-leadership-in-mobile-technology-evolution-6g-and-beyond/"" rel=""nofollow"">ATIS Next G Alliance Sets Direction for North America Leadership in Mobile Technology Evolution – 6G and Beyond</a> appeared first on <a href=""https://www.atis.org"" rel=""nofollow"">ATIS</a>.</p>'}","Thu, 03 Dec 2020 22:40:19 +0000",https://www.atis.org/atis-next-g-alliance-sets-direction-for-north-america-leadership-in-mobile-technology-evolution-6g-and-beyond/?utm_source=rss&utm_medium=rss&utm_campaign=atis-next-g-alliance-sets-direction-for-north-america-leadership-in-mobile-technology-evolution-6g-and-beyond,telecom

Over the last few years, we have seen IT and telecommunications services evolve from dedicated centralized infrastructure, where today these are deployed across distributed virtualized cloud providers. In doing so, the traditional controls for managing identity, security and data privacy can present many challenges.</p>\n<p><strong>The growing threat of IoT-based cyberattacks</strong><br />\nThe plethora of innovative low-cost internet of things (IoT) devices that typically ship with default security passwords are connecting with a broad range of IT services. As IoT adoption grows, hackers see new opportunities to spread malicious software to millions of IoT devices, which can then be leveraged in a coordinated distributed denial-of-service (DDoS) attack.</p>\n<p>We have seen many examples in the news where centralized systems are compromised through these attacks. A DDoS attack floods systems, servers or networks with traffic to exhaust resources and bandwidth. As a result, the system is unable to fulfill legitimate requests. Attackers can also use multiple compromised devices to launch this attack.</p>\n<p>Today, most IT security systems are based on central servers, used to identify and authenticate individual connecting IoT devices. Any centralization makes servers inherently vulnerable to potential DDoS and brute force attacks. If this centralized resource is compromised, everything attached and the service it provides will be equally affected.</p>\n<p>In 2016, in possibly the most severe example of this, there was an attack on the internet DNS service provider Dyn. In this attack, millions of internet digital cameras and DVR players were infected with special malware, known as a “botnet.” The cameras were coordinated into bombarding a server with traffic until it collapsed under the strain. The result brought down the internet across North America, affecting top internet-based brands, including Airbnb, Twitter, PayPal and Netflix.</p>\n<p><strong>Distributed ledger security foundations</strong><br />\nDistributed ledger technologies or blockchain, as they are commonly referred to, are currently being used to power and secure a cryptocurrency market worth over US <a href=""https://coinmarketcap.com/"">$368 billion</a> as of September 2020.</p>\n<p>DLT/blockchain is a truly distributed system, which has built-in protections against many potential cybersecurity and fraud attacks. The largest blockchain network today, Bitcoin, has more than 100,000 nodes. In 10 years of operation, its protocol has warded off several attempts made to attack this network. This distributed infrastructure of nodes makes it extremely difficult for a successful cyberattack. Multiple blockchain nodes across many different institutions must be attacked to overwhelm the full system.</p>\n<p>A distributed ledger foundation for secure access and transactions is based on cryptography functions from public-key cryptography. The system uses asymmetric cryptography, also known as public-key cryptography, using public and private keys to encrypt and decrypt data. The keys are simply large numbers that have been paired together but are not identical, referred to as “asymmetric keys.”</p>\n<p>One key kept secret is called the private key. The private key is used to encrypt messages and ensure the identity of the owner recording information or transacting on the blockchain can be trusted. The other key is called the public key. The public key is used to verify that the message sent is from the holder of a specific private key. Public keys are distributed on the distributed ledger blockchain enabling anyone to use them to verify the identity and authenticity of a message or transaction. This method eliminates the need for personal data, i.e., username/password, to be used as a means of authenticated access.</p>\n<p><strong>How distributed ledger technology can enhance IoT security</strong><br />\nBillions of IoT devices are being produced and shipped to consumers globally. Typically, manufacturers configure into the firmware default usernames/passwords enabling the devices to be shipped anywhere and be easily installed.</p>\n<p>Instead, the manufacturers of these IoT devices can embed into the firmware a unique private key for each IoT device, storing each device identity with its corresponding public key onto a distributed ledger. The use of these unique keys gives each IoT device its own unique trusted identity that can be authenticated by any application using the public key from the distributed ledger.</p>\n<p>Most distributed ledger/blockchain private keys use SHA256 hashing to secure transactions. In broad terms, a supercomputer that can perform 15 trillion calculations per second employed in cracking a hash would take more than a billion years to crack the hash of a single blockchain identity. Not only would it take a long time, but the cost to infiltrate a single device would make it very difficult and impractical to recruit a sufficient number of devices to coordinate a DDoS attack using IoT devices.</p>\n<p>Instead of having all the IoT device identities and public keys in a central resource, these can be stored on a distributed ledger and be used to authenticate and verify IoT devices. Through use of a distributed ledger, each service or application provider can host its own node to ensure they have a local copy of the blockchain. More importantly, service providers can mitigate DDoS attacks attempting to disrupt service availability.</p>\n<p>DLT and blockchain have proven their security capabilities over the last ten years. By integrating an IoT device identity and authentications service onto a distributed ledger will help to mitigate many of the known DDoS attack possibilities we have seen to date.</p>\n<p><strong>ATIS Distributed Ledger Project.</strong><br />\nIn 2017, ATIS launched the <a href=""https://www.atis.org/initiatives/distributed-ledger-technology/"">DLT Initiative</a> to validate key aspects of distributed ledger technology as applied to real-world challenges facing today’s communications industry. As part of this work, ATIS generated a technical report, “<a href=""https://www.atis.org/resources/enterprise-identity-on-distributed-ledger-for-authenticated-caller-use-cases/"" rel=""noopener"" target=""_blank"">Enterprise Identity on Distributed Ledger for Authenticated Caller Use Cases</a>.” It describes how DLT will provide enterprise identity verification to authenticate the originating caller information in IP communication networks. The report also addresses problems associated with attestation of a telephone number (TN) due to enterprise multihoming with originating service providers that are not the allocation provider of the TN, within IP communication networks. The solution is called the “<strong>ATIS Enterprise Identity Network</strong>,” and you can access a brief and engaging video clip on its benefits to stakeholders <a href=""https://www.atis.org/initiatives/distributed-ledger-technology/"">here</a>.</p>\n<p>The same DLT-based TN Identity service could also support IoT identities to be authenticated by communication service providers, enterprise verticals and applications providers.

The TRACED Act calls for the FCC to require providers of voice services within 18 months (June 30, 2021) to:</p>\n<ul>\n<li>Implement the STIR/SHAKEN authentication framework in the internet protocol networks of the provider of voice service; and</li>\n<li>Take reasonable measures to implement an effective call authentication framework in the provider’s non-internet protocol (i.e., TDM) networks.</li>\n</ul>\n<p>The recently formed\xa0<a href=""https://www.atis.org/initiatives/non-ip-taskforce/"">Non-IP Call Authentication Task Force (NIPCA TF)</a>, part of ATIS’\xa0<a href=""https://www.atis.org/01_committ_forums/ptsc/"">Packet Technologies and Systems Committee (PTSC)</a>, will focus on the second requirement, addressing the implementation of call authentication in non-internet protocol networks.</p>\n<p>Why is this necessary?</p>\n<p>There remains a significant portion of the voice network that is not capable of initiating, maintaining and terminating SIP calls, and as a result is not able to authenticate or verify calls under the SHAKEN framework.\xa0 Based on the most recently issued\xa0<a href=""https://www.fcc.gov/voice-telephone-services-report"">Voice Telephone Services Report from the FCC</a>\xa0(issued March 2020 for data through 12/31/2018 DOC-362882A1) – approximately 40 percent of voice circuits remain non-IP based. In addition, SHAKEN requires that calls be IP end-to-end, and cannot be used if any portion of the call path is non-IP.</p>\n<p>The TRACED Act implicitly recognizes this challenge, allowing for a potential extension to the deadlines if they create undue hardship for voice service providers that use TDM network technology. However, the TRACED Act still requires voice service providers to take “reasonable measures” to implement an effective Caller ID authentication framework in non-IP portions of their networks.\xa0 This is an important statement in that the “reasonable measures” clause may be satisfied only if the voice service provider is actively working to implement a Caller ID authentication framework on the non-IP portions of its network by either upgrading to IP so that STIR/SHAKEN may be implemented or by working to develop a non-IP authentication mechanism.\xa0 Participation in ATIS’ NIPCA TF can satisfy this requirement. Through it, service providers can demonstrate that they are actively working to address call authentication challenges.</p>\n<p>The NIPCA TF leverages ATIS’ deep technical expertise and proven ability to develop communications standards. ATIS has been at the forefront of call authentication initiatives through the joint ATIS/SIP Forum IP-NNI Task Force. In this role, it brings critical expertise to this initiative, including call authentication standards for IP networks, a deep understanding of TDM network standards, and an ability to bring these two areas together to assess call authentication options in non-IP networks.</p>\n<p>In a very short period, the ATIS NIPCA Task Force has formed and undertaken the development of a technical report regarding alternatives for caller authentication for non-IP traffic and has already received a number of proposals for Call Authentication Frameworks for TDM networks providing the basis for a robust technical program.</p>\n<p>The ATIS NIPCA TF welcomes and encourages all interested parties (including non-ATIS members) to participate.\xa0 The goals of the Task Force are to:\xa0 1) Understand the problems and challenges; 2) Educate TDM experts on call authentication; 3) Investigate the feasibility of TDM call authentication frameworks, including how these would interwork with SHAKEN; and 4) Evaluate the viability of implementing proposed call authentication mechanisms for TDM networks.\xa0\xa0<a href=""https://www.atis.org/initiatives/non-ip-taskforce/"">Learn more</a>\xa0about the NIPCA TF.</p>\n<p>The post <a href=""https://www.atis.org/the-other-40-of-the-network-atis-addresses-tdm-network-call-authentication/"" rel=""nofollow"">The Other 40% of the Network: ATIS Addresses TDM Network Call Authentication</a> appeared first on <a href=""https://www.atis.org"" rel=""nofollow"">ATIS</a>.</p>'}","Sat, 15 Aug 2020 06:00:58 +0000",https://www.atis.org/the-other-40-of-the-network-atis-addresses-tdm-network-call-authentication/?utm_source=rss&utm_medium=rss&utm_campaign=the-other-40-of-the-network-atis-addresses-tdm-network-call-authentication,telecom

Therefore, as 5G specifications progress in 3GPP Release 17 and beyond, it is important to keep sight of these specific needs in order to ensure that the future 3GPP specifications can be aligned with them.</p>\n<p>In coming years, the landscape will be shaped by the convergence of emerging technologies with societal trends and new business models. The cumulative impact of these three trends will define the path forward and shape the agenda for future 3GPP releases. Areas for consideration will include key verticals such as industrial, automation, agriculture, transportation, health care and energy as well as media / entertainment, public safety and smart cities.</p>\n<p>Read the full report\xa0<a href=""https://access.atis.org/apps/group_public/download.php/54696/ATIS-I-0000078.pdf""><em>5G Specifications in 3GPP: North American Needs for the 5G Future</em></a>.</p>\n<p>The post <a href=""https://www.atis.org/5g-evolution-the-next-phase/"" rel=""nofollow"">5G Evolution – The Next Phase</a> appeared first on <a href=""https://www.atis.org"" rel=""nofollow"">ATIS</a>.</p>'}","Fri, 31 Jul 2020 04:41:42 +0000",https://www.atis.org/5g-evolution-the-next-phase/?utm_source=rss&utm_medium=rss&utm_campaign=5g-evolution-the-next-phase,telecom

This could be as straightforward as remotely monitoring the status of a machine. Alternatively, it might involve the use of technology to update software on a set of digital displays or a fleet of vehicles.</p>\n<p>The nature of each problem determines the technical choices made. For example, an IoT developer might choose the\xa0<a href=""http://www.openmobilealliance.org/wp/OMNA/LwM2M/LwM2MRegistry.html"" rel=""noopener noreferrer"" target=""_blank"">LWM2M protocol</a>\xa0if device management is seen as critical. If they are concerned about low-power connectivity over large distances, they will construct a solution using SigFox or NB-IoT technologies. If payload efficiency is a priority, they might choose between\xa0<a href=""https://coap.technology/"" rel=""noopener noreferrer"" target=""_blank"">CoAP</a>\xa0and\xa0<a href=""https://mqtt.org/"" rel=""noopener noreferrer"" target=""_blank"">MQTT</a>\xa0connectivity protocols. These are some of the technology choices that IoT developers face. It is often simpler to work with an IoT platform whose capabilities represent a toolkit of programmed functions that shield developers from these technology complexities.</p>\n<h3><strong>New Needs and New Tools</strong></h3>\n<p>After some time in service, the expectations of an IoT system are likely to evolve. There might be a need for more functionality. This could involve linking two or more IoT solutions to enable a new way of using data, possibly crossing departmental boundaries. In this situation, complexity depends on whether the two-silo solutions use common conventions, which makes interoperability possible. This depends on how device and application identities are managed, for example, and whether a translation gateway is required between domains. Yet another interoperability requirement might involve a procedure where one IoT solution notifies another when an action is triggered by some application logic.</p>\n<p>IoT platforms eliminate many of these issues in situations where different IoT solutions use the same platform. However, matters get complicated if IoT solutions use different platforms. This can arise in the case of several related participants in an extended supply chain.</p>\n<p>Of course, platform providers can add new capabilities to address new needs over time. However, this can be costly on a one-off basis. A better strategy is to think in terms of a toolkit of capabilities applied to a framework of IoT devices, gateways, and platform. The platform provider can add new capabilities to the platform over time without redesigning the technology stack. This is analogous to adding new tools to a toolbox as opposed to creating different configurations of a Swiss Army knife for each separate IoT solution.</p>\n<p>To illustrate this concept, consider the case of an IoT solution that requires a set of service functions for device management (e.g. LWM2M), registration (for sensor, device, and application identities) and communications management (to handle a mix of MQTT and HTTPS traffic). Later, the developer might want to enhance the solution by implementing tiered access levels or to customize data privacy policies for different users. After that, there is the possibility of distributing and monetizing IoT data, which will require yet more tools.</p>\n<h3><strong>Common Service Functions</strong></h3>\n<p>While each IoT solution is different, all depend on a set of common service functions (CSFs). These are analogous to tools in the IoT developer’s toolbox. CSFs may reside in IoT platform nodes (i.e. gateways and servers) and serve the purpose of maintaining communications between IoT devices, sensors, and other IoT platforms.</p>\n<p>As systems evolve in complexity, the basic CSF toolkit will continue to grow. This is a requirement that its founders anticipated when they created the\xa0<a href=""https://onem2m.org/"" rel=""noopener noreferrer"" target=""_blank"">oneM2M</a>\xa0standardization organization in 2012. Its members went on to specify an architectural framework for IoT solutions based on middleware technology in the horizontal layer that sits between IoT applications and, lower level devices and communications networks. As illustrated, oneM2M’s middleware technology currently comprises fourteen CSFs.</p>\n<p><img alt="""" class=""aligncenter wp-image-8530"" height=""291"" src=""https://www.atis.org/wp-content/uploads/2020/09/onem2m-common-service-functions.png"" width=""600"" /></p>\n<p>Developers can begin with a subset of CSFs from the toolkit to solve the initial deployment challenges of launching an IoT solution. Later on, they can introduce other CSFs progressively as they add data discovery, semantic interoperability, usage charging, and other capabilities to their solutions.</p>\n<h3><strong>The Role of oneM2M CSFs in Enabling Key Business Processes</strong></h3>\n<p>Data marketplaces are emerging as an important class of IoT systems in several IoT industry verticals. The intention is to share IoT data among several ecosystem partners and to support multiple use cases, not just one, via a horizontal architecture that provides a common and scalable environment. There, owners of connected assets can supply IoT data to developers who consume data. Data consumers are less interested in deploying sensors and care more about building IoT applications to solve business and operational problems.</p>\n<p>In the context of connected vehicles, mobility services or smart region initiatives, data marketplaces allow cities and other users of the transportation network to share data under controlled conditions. That establishes the foundation for a wide variety of smart city and intelligent transport solutions. Examples include congestion management, intelligent use of parking resources, coordination of incidents with traffic police, and mobility services that involve connected and autonomous vehicles. Such use cases are typical of the business-process and technical issues that cities are grappling with and exploring through the\xa0<a href=""https://www.atis.org/scde/"" rel=""noopener noreferrer"" target=""_blank"">ATIS Smart Cities Data Exchange initiative</a>.</p>\n<p>The horizontal platform approach takes the form of simple architecture based on oneM2M standards. As illustrated, the foundation contains the oneM2M Service Layer and a set of CSFs to manage IoT data from a range of transport data assets. The next layer exposes raw and value-added data, derived from the application of transportation analytics, to data consumers. These data consumers then develop applications such as for travel planning, parking, and other services in the uppermost layer.</p>\n<h3><strong>Business Processes and oneM2M Capabilities to Enable a Transportation Data Marketplace</strong></h3>\n<p><img alt="""" class=""aligncenter wp-image-8531"" height=""338"" src=""https://www.atis.org/wp-content/uploads/2020/09/onem2m-business-processes.png"" width=""600"" /></p>\n<p>Within the oneM2M Service Layer, the first key business process is to manage data from different sources. This uses the Data Management &amp; Repository CSF and the standardized oneM2M information model. Together, they provide a common framework to store diverse types of static and time-series data. The second CSF that supports data management is the Discovery CSF which enables applications to query and easily discover data from various types of devices in the system. The third CSF that supports data management is the Subscription &amp; Notification CSF. It enables applications to subscribe to events of interest such as a threshold to indicate that traffic congestion has reached a certain level.</p>\n<p>A second business process is to establish and manage service subscription accounts. This uses the Registration CSF which allows a system administrator to associate policies that define the identity and lifetime of a service subscription. The third key business process is to enable the data marketplace operator to apply policy controls to manage access to the system.\xa0 The Registration and Security CSFs provide control over individual user subscriptions in terms of how many resources they can create and how much data they can upload. Such usage statistics are one element in the process of monetizing data via the Service Charging and Accounting CSF.</p>\n<h3><strong>Roadmap for New IoT Capabilities</strong></h3>\n<p>Since the publication of its Release 1 standards, oneM2M members have continued to\xa0<a href=""https://onem2m.org/membership/list-of-deployments"" rel=""noopener noreferrer"" target=""_blank"">develop and deploy its technical capabilities</a>. In addition to regular interoperability testing events, work is close to finalizing new capabilities for inclusion in the\xa0<a href=""https://www.brighttalk.com/webcast/11949/404700"" rel=""noopener noreferrer"" target=""_blank"">Release 4</a>\xa0“toolkit”.

Because DNS is such a critical network function, its robustness and security are of profound importance. Important changes to the security of DNS protocols are now underway. These will have an impact on all organizations that offer DNS services or depend on features implemented in DNS.</p>\n<p>Almost all Internet applications rely on DNS to allow the client to find the required server and obtain other information related to the domain. Currently, a large majority (approximately 80%) of DNS queries in public networks are handled by the user’s Internet Service Provider (ISP). This allows ISPs to use DNS to fulfill operational needs and offer services. In managed private networks belonging to enterprises and other organizations (e.g., schools) users often connect to dedicated DNS services that offer special enterprise services including network security services and private network name-spaces.</p>\n<p>Today, most DNS signaling is sent using protocols that do not support security provisions, presenting both privacy and security risks for users. As such, new protocols have been specified that implement cryptographic DNS security and data confidentiality. Support for these is now being introduced in client software (primarily web browsers) and in DNS servers.</p>\n<p>These changes in DNS technology and implementation practices are now creating both challenges and opportunities.</p>\n<p>The IETF has standardized protocols for the use of encrypted DNS: DNS over HTTPS (DoH) and DNS over TLS (DoT). These technologies can enhance the security of DNS protocol, however, the method for how to deploy and operationalize these protocols is largely undefined. As such, browsers and mobile operating systems are using a variety of different approaches that could dramatically change the Internet architecture and have marked impacts on important DNS-based features. While the use of DoT and DoH can have benefits for user security and privacy, the current piecemeal deployments raise complex issues for many stakeholders. Both organizational and technical responses are needed to address these.</p>\n<p>DoT and DoH have similar cryptographic security properties, but the different encapsulation protocols have implications for system design. DoT can give networks some insight into DNS traffic, while DNS over DoH is stealthier and emphasizes privacy (e.g., to cope with environments where the user does not trust the local network).\xa0 Although user data is secured in both protocols, network administrators may view this as a network security vs. privacy conundrum.</p>\n<p>Despite the fact that the implementation of DNS security protocols can have a range of positive benefits, it can also conflict with important network services that are currently widely implemented based on DNS. These services include techniques to mitigate malware and fulfill legal obligations placed on network operators. DoH has particular security implications as it is designed to be resistant to simple approaches for policy enforcement and monitoring in the network.</p>\n<p>A recently released ATIS report,\xa0<a href=""https://www.atis.org/resources/technical-impacts-of-dns-privacy-and-security-on-network-service-scenarios/""><em>Technical Impacts of DNS Privacy and Security on Network Service Scenarios</em></a><em>,</em>\xa0describes the technical impacts of DNS security protocols in a range of network scenarios and identifies impacts on systems in three main areas:</p>\n<ol>\n<li>The absence of industry norms for how to deploy and operationalize encrypted DNS in servers and clients is leading to the adoption of piecemeal solutions that differ in each implementation.</li>\n<li>By selecting their own DNS servers, some clients are disregarding DNS server provisioning information received from the network (e.g., in Dynamic Host Configuration Protocol). These clients can be disruptive to a range of network services, including security and legally required services, that are implemented in ISP and managed private network DNS servers today.</li>\n<li>Implementations of network security features (e.g., malware detection and blocking) as well as the implementation of national legal requirements in public networks and network policy controls in managed private networks could be affected. This is because support of confidentiality in DoT and DoH may prevent operation of any network services implemented in “middle boxes” that rely on DNS queries and responses being in clear text.</li>\n</ol>\n<p><a href=""https://www.atis.org/resources/technical-impacts-of-dns-privacy-and-security-on-network-service-scenarios/""><em>Technical Impacts of DNS Privacy and Security on Network Service Scenarios</em></a>\xa0presents scenarios that illustrate some of the different contexts in which DNS may be used, with each scenario presenting different considerations for DoT and DoH deployment. These scenarios should be used to guide decision-making by clients and servers deploying DoT and DoH. They can also be used by organizations impacted by DoT and DoH to help formulate their strategy.</p>\n<p>The report also contains a set of talking points which ISPs, as well as other parties, can use to communicate about these topics to end users, enterprise network administrators and internal stakeholders. Finally, it provides key recommendations for different stakeholders to encourage collaboration among all stakeholders to create technical standards and best practices for the deployment of DoT and DoH. The goal is to maximize the benefits of DNS security support while reducing problem areas.

Yet these varying requirements present service providers with new challenges, requiring the underlying network infrastructure to meet a variety of different functionality and performance requirements.</p>\n\n\n\n<p>A key element in making all this happen is the ability of 5G to adapt network resources in both the user plane and the control plane to meet the performance levels of each service and device. Network slicing has been devised as a way to structure a network to support diverse classes of services in a guaranteed way on the same network.</p>\n\n\n\n<p>By “slicing” the single physical network into multiple, virtual, end-to-end networks, a service provider can software-define the necessary performance criteria – such as speed, security, coverage area, etc. to match the requirements needed by a service using the slice.</p>\n\n\n\n<p>With network slicing, network functions and resources that are specifically tailored to a vertical market’s requirements are logically isolated, creating multiple virtual networks on top of a common shared physical infrastructure.</p>\n\n\n\n<p>At present, network slices are categorized into different types according to the abstraction of characteristics of the services they facilitate. The Third Generation Partnership Project (3GPP) has defined four network slice types; (1) Enhanced Mobile Broadband (eMBB); (2) Ultra-Reliable Low-Latency Communications (URLLC); (3) massive Internet of Things (mIoT); and (4) V2X.</p>\n\n\n\n<p>These slice types are based on the typical characteristics required for use cases and verticals to provide a way for establishing global interoperability for slicing.</p>\n\n\n\n<h2><strong><em>Are more “slices” needed?</em></strong></h2>\n\n\n\n<p>ATIS recently released an innovative new report, <em><a href=""https://access.atis.org/apps/group_public/download.php/51129/ATIS-I-0000075.pdf"" rel=""noreferrer noopener"" target=""_blank"">IoT Categorization: Exploring the Need for Standardizing Additional Network Slices</a></em>, that examines the topic of network slicing.\xa0 Its objective is to identify areas of commonality across IoT devices and applications and examine how these may be grouped into standard network slices to keep service quality consistent across different networks and operators.</p>\n\n\n\n<p>The report considers the network requirements across the multidimensional landscape of IoT devices and applications to identify if any additional network slice types may be defined to ensure consistent service quality across operators.</p>\n\n\n\n<p>While existing IoT initiatives take an application-centric approach, often from the perspective of a single application or industry vertical, ATIS’ IoT Categorization Initiative examines IoT from a network-centric perspective to determine an effective way to categorize IoT into a small number of meaningful categories based on device types, applications, services, or a combination of these; as well as business, technology, and regulatory implications.</p>\n\n\n\n<p>To provide structure for the analysis, the major IoT application groups are identified and decomposed into further use cases along with the IoT devices used.\xa0 Key performance characteristics that influence network slice requirements are identified. Each application/IoT device grouping is mapped to a network slice, highlighting any areas that may warrant a new slice type. The resulting “living” IoT Categorization Matrix forms the basis for identifying areas of commonality that can be used to determine if additional network slice types are needed to support the varied IoT applications and devices that will connect to the network.</p>\n\n\n\n<p>Standardized definitions for the most commonly used slice types provide a mechanism for enabling roaming, as well as global interoperability for network slicing across network operators.</p>\n\n\n\n<p>Through IoT Categorization, a smaller subset of the applications and devices were found to exhibit characteristics across multiple slices that were not a perfect match to the currently defined four standardized slice types. \xa0This has resulted in the recommendation for consideration of an additional standardized slice type to address the performance requirements for this subset, which encompasses use cases across industrial automation, robotic surgery, and public safety.</p>\n\n\n\n<p>The proposed new network slice type, High-Performance Machine-Type Communications (HMTC), would be defined by the key performance characteristics common to the applications in the above subset, including low latency, high availability, and high data rates. Although similar to the characteristics of the newly defined V2X slice, no mobility or sidelink is required.</p>\n\n\n\n<p>5G is envisioned to support a wide range of IoT verticals with a diverse set of performance and service requirements. Network slicing is a key component of the 5G architecture, enabling network operators to expand their customer base and offer new, differentiated services. Through network slicing, operators can allocate their network resources based on a precise set of performance requirements. Defining a sufficient number of standardized network slice types is essential as customers will expect the same level of service no matter where they are. With the addition of the recommended HMTC slice definition, the resulting standardized slice types should address the most commonly used services and associated performance characteristics. Providing this broader set of standard slice types ensures roaming support, as well as global interoperability for network slicing across network operators. In sum, it is part of what it will take to help 5G reach its potential.</p>\n<p>The post <a href=""https://www.atis.org/iot-categorization-exploring-the-need-for-standardizing-additional-network-slices/"" rel=""nofollow"">IOT Categorization: Exploring the Need for Standardizing Additional Network Slices</a> appeared first on <a href=""https://www.atis.org"" rel=""nofollow"">ATIS</a>.</p>'}","Fri, 03 Jan 2020 01:00:36 +0000",https://www.atis.org/iot-categorization-exploring-the-need-for-standardizing-additional-network-slices/?utm_source=rss&utm_medium=rss&utm_campaign=iot-categorization-exploring-the-need-for-standardizing-additional-network-slices,telecom

This model also makes it impossible for organizations to achieve their cybersecurity goals since in the end, constant requests for added funding, time, and resources cannot be met.\xa0</p>\n\n\n\n<h2><strong>The Collaborative Cybersecurity Model</strong></h2>\n\n\n\n<p>In contrast to the current model, the Collective Cybersecurity Model is all about collaborating with participating cybersecurity companies, vehicle OEMs and their suppliers, sharing and exchanging cybersecurity-related information in a continuous real-time manner.\xa0From a high level, when signing on to this model, no partner keeps any information to itself and or waits to share information.\xa0Once information is shared, the partners work together to address the issue as one company.\xa0This way, vehicle OEMs will interact with, a single entity — not four or five different cybersecurity companies.\xa0It’s that simple.\xa0</p>\n\n\n\n<p>The key concepts are “share and exchange” and “continuous real-time.” Threat related information is always made available to all partners for analysis and action when and/or if necessary.\xa0Not only is the threat info shared, but so is the evolving analysis of the threat as well as any required actions to counter it.</p>\n\n\n\n<p>As part of the three-plus years of research ATIS has conducted on <a href=""https://www.atis.org/01_strat_init/connectedcar/"" rel=""noreferrer noopener"" target=""_blank"">Collaborative Cybersecurity</a>, working with the various cybersecurity companies, it is undeniable that every industry needs to revamp its current cybersecurity model. Industries should move to a model that is collaborative at its very roots. A collaborative model will produce the most effective and timely information and provide the best overall protection against the gambit of cyber threats that continue to evolve and grow.</p>\n\n\n\n<h2><strong>Key Elements </strong></h2>\n\n\n\n<p>The Collaborative Cybersecurity model is defined by five Key Elements which consist of the following:</p>\n\n\n\n<ol>\n<li>Threat Intelligence</li>\n<li>Hardware Security</li>\n<li>Software Security</li>\n<li>Network Security</li>\n<li>Cloud Security</li>\n</ol>\n\n\n\n<p>Outlined below are some examples of the high-level functional requirements that fall under each of the Key Elements.\xa0\xa0The functions listed below are by no means exhaustive but serve as a guide as to what one would expect to see under each pillar.\xa0\xa0</p>\n\n\n\n<figure class=""wp-block-image""><img alt="""" class=""wp-image-1959"" src=""https://sites.atis.org/wp-content/uploads/2019/12/collaborative-cybersecurity-model-1024x599.jpg"" /></figure>\n\n\n\n<h2><strong>Conclusions</strong></h2>\n\n\n\n<p>Whenever there is talk of disruptive technology, methods, and processes challenging the Status Quo, there is always a good dose of skepticism.\xa0Some will knock the idea down because it doesn’t fit within their plans. Some will want to protect their interests by retaining the current way of doing business. Even if it is proven to be a failed model to address new cybersecurity problems that keep growing, adapting, and getting smarter faster.\xa0</p>\n\n\n\n<p>Cybersecurity and technology companies need to bring their diverse expertise, experience, and knowledge to the table to showcase the value of a Collaborative Cybersecurity Model for the vehicle OEM industry. If vehicle OEMs cannot demonstrate and develop a coordinated and collaborative cybersecurity strategy to safeguard consumers, governments will likely step in quite vigorously.\xa0Governments may enact specific mandated cybersecurity policies/laws that vehicle OEMs may find expensive and time-consuming to develop, introduce, and support.</p>\n\n\n\n<p>Learn more about the <a href=""https://www.atis.org/01_strat_init/connectedcar/"" rel=""noreferrer noopener"" target=""_blank"">ATIS Connected Vehicle Cybersecurity initiative</a>.</p>\n\n\n\n<p>Read the full post from which this blog is excerpted <a href=""https://www.linkedin.com/pulse/collaborative-cybersecurity-connected-vehicles-denis-niles/"" rel=""noreferrer noopener"" target=""_blank"">here</a>.\xa0 \xa0</p>\n<p>The post <a href=""https://www.atis.org/collaborative-cybersecurity-for-connected-vehicles/"" rel=""nofollow"">Collaborative Cybersecurity for Connected Vehicles</a> appeared first on <a href=""https://www.atis.org"" rel=""nofollow"">ATIS</a>.</p>'}","Tue, 03 Dec 2019 20:35:12 +0000",https://www.atis.org/collaborative-cybersecurity-for-connected-vehicles/?utm_source=rss&utm_medium=rss&utm_campaign=collaborative-cybersecurity-for-connected-vehicles,telecom

But what comes next on the horizon in terms of the future of mobile technology? To answer this question, research and development initiatives have already started in multiple countries and regions around the globe to work on the next generation in the evolution of mobile:\xa0 6G. Although the 6G vision is still to be defined, it is expected that the next generation of mobile technology will build on the capabilities of more bandwidth, lower latency, additional spectrum and greater reliability, 6G is expected to apply new cognitive, predictive and contextual capabilities to deliver a yet-to-be-imagined level of user experience.</p>\n<p>As such, it is a strategic imperative that North America establish itself as the global leader in the ideas, development, adoption and rapid commercialization of 6G, while continuing to work with global partners in areas like standards leadership to assure a broad marketplace for 6G solutions. ATIS has established the <a href=""https://nextgalliance.org/"">Next G Alliance</a> to provide the foundation for North America to develop a 6G national roadmap and set of research priorities. The goal is that these not only spur development and innovation but ultimately drive economic growth and commercialization success for the entire region. By leveraging the knowledge gained from the development and early deployments of 5G, the North America market is well positioned to advance mobile technology leadership in 6G and beyond.</p>\n<p>The Next G Alliance is a collaborative effort across industry and academia that will encompass the full lifecycle of research and development, manufacturing, standardization, market readiness and commercialization of 6G. It was born out of ATIS’ <a href=""https://www.atis.org/wp-content/uploads/2020/07/Promoting-US-Leadership-on-Path-to-6G.pdf"">Call to Action</a> issued in May 2020 to extend the benefits of 5G commercialization within the U.S. to a 6G world that delivers innovative services and customer experiences beyond network boundaries, physical environments and geographic constraints. The Call to Action identifies a proposed list of core Next G technologies as well as recommendations on government actions to stimulate innovation and development. Building on the Call to Action, the key strategic actions of the Next G Alliance are to:</p>\n<ul>\n<li>Create a 6G national roadmap that will promote a vibrant marketplace for 6G introduction, adoption and commercialization with U.S. innovation in mind</li>\n<li>Develop a set of national priorities that will influence government applied research funding and promote incentivized government actions</li>\n<li>Progress a North American model that promotes development across the full lifecycle of research to realization, aligned with commercialization outcomes</li>\n</ul>\n<p>Who is setting this strategy into action? The Next G Alliance encourages participation across all stakeholders in the mobile industry, including mobility service providers; ICT industry companies; network systems providers, operations and business software providers; start-ups; industry vertical companies as well as other industry association partners. Being a member of the Next G Alliance does not require participants to be a member of ATIS.</p>\n<p>Beyond the enablement of applications that exceed any previous generation of mobile technology, 6G will further change the way data is created, processed and consumed. This may spur new business models, forms of data ownership, and related policies. The Next G Alliance’s work will position a range of entities, including operators, resource brokers, services and application providers as well as trust and security providers to reap the benefits of a 6G economy.</p>\n<p>The path to this future will undoubtedly present new challenges but also the potential for exciting new opportunities for both existing and new participants. The Next G Alliance is seizing a critical opportunity to ensure future generations of mobile technology deliver the maximum benefit to all stakeholders and that North America drives the vision of how we get there.</p>\n<p>&nbsp;</p>\n<p>&nbsp;</p>\n<br /><br /><br /><br /><br /><br />\n<p>The post <a href=""https://www.atis.org/atis-next-g-alliance-sets-direction-for-north-america-leadership-in-mobile-technology-evolution-6g-and-beyond/"" rel=""nofollow"">ATIS Next G Alliance Sets Direction for North America Leadership in Mobile Technology Evolution – 6G and Beyond</a> appeared first on <a href=""https://www.atis.org"" rel=""nofollow"">ATIS</a>.</p>'}","Thu, 03 Dec 2020 22:40:19 +0000",https://www.atis.org/atis-next-g-alliance-sets-direction-for-north-america-leadership-in-mobile-technology-evolution-6g-and-beyond/?utm_source=rss&utm_medium=rss&utm_campaign=atis-next-g-alliance-sets-direction-for-north-america-leadership-in-mobile-technology-evolution-6g-and-beyond,telecom

Over the last few years, we have seen IT and telecommunications services evolve from dedicated centralized infrastructure, where today these are deployed across distributed virtualized cloud providers. In doing so, the traditional controls for managing identity, security and data privacy can present many challenges.</p>\n<p><strong>The growing threat of IoT-based cyberattacks</strong><br />\nThe plethora of innovative low-cost internet of things (IoT) devices that typically ship with default security passwords are connecting with a broad range of IT services. As IoT adoption grows, hackers see new opportunities to spread malicious software to millions of IoT devices, which can then be leveraged in a coordinated distributed denial-of-service (DDoS) attack.</p>\n<p>We have seen many examples in the news where centralized systems are compromised through these attacks. A DDoS attack floods systems, servers or networks with traffic to exhaust resources and bandwidth. As a result, the system is unable to fulfill legitimate requests. Attackers can also use multiple compromised devices to launch this attack.</p>\n<p>Today, most IT security systems are based on central servers, used to identify and authenticate individual connecting IoT devices. Any centralization makes servers inherently vulnerable to potential DDoS and brute force attacks. If this centralized resource is compromised, everything attached and the service it provides will be equally affected.</p>\n<p>In 2016, in possibly the most severe example of this, there was an attack on the internet DNS service provider Dyn. In this attack, millions of internet digital cameras and DVR players were infected with special malware, known as a “botnet.” The cameras were coordinated into bombarding a server with traffic until it collapsed under the strain. The result brought down the internet across North America, affecting top internet-based brands, including Airbnb, Twitter, PayPal and Netflix.</p>\n<p><strong>Distributed ledger security foundations</strong><br />\nDistributed ledger technologies or blockchain, as they are commonly referred to, are currently being used to power and secure a cryptocurrency market worth over US <a href=""https://coinmarketcap.com/"">$368 billion</a> as of September 2020.</p>\n<p>DLT/blockchain is a truly distributed system, which has built-in protections against many potential cybersecurity and fraud attacks. The largest blockchain network today, Bitcoin, has more than 100,000 nodes. In 10 years of operation, its protocol has warded off several attempts made to attack this network. This distributed infrastructure of nodes makes it extremely difficult for a successful cyberattack. Multiple blockchain nodes across many different institutions must be attacked to overwhelm the full system.</p>\n<p>A distributed ledger foundation for secure access and transactions is based on cryptography functions from public-key cryptography. The system uses asymmetric cryptography, also known as public-key cryptography, using public and private keys to encrypt and decrypt data. The keys are simply large numbers that have been paired together but are not identical, referred to as “asymmetric keys.”</p>\n<p>One key kept secret is called the private key. The private key is used to encrypt messages and ensure the identity of the owner recording information or transacting on the blockchain can be trusted. The other key is called the public key. The public key is used to verify that the message sent is from the holder of a specific private key. Public keys are distributed on the distributed ledger blockchain enabling anyone to use them to verify the identity and authenticity of a message or transaction. This method eliminates the need for personal data, i.e., username/password, to be used as a means of authenticated access.</p>\n<p><strong>How distributed ledger technology can enhance IoT security</strong><br />\nBillions of IoT devices are being produced and shipped to consumers globally. Typically, manufacturers configure into the firmware default usernames/passwords enabling the devices to be shipped anywhere and be easily installed.</p>\n<p>Instead, the manufacturers of these IoT devices can embed into the firmware a unique private key for each IoT device, storing each device identity with its corresponding public key onto a distributed ledger. The use of these unique keys gives each IoT device its own unique trusted identity that can be authenticated by any application using the public key from the distributed ledger.</p>\n<p>Most distributed ledger/blockchain private keys use SHA256 hashing to secure transactions. In broad terms, a supercomputer that can perform 15 trillion calculations per second employed in cracking a hash would take more than a billion years to crack the hash of a single blockchain identity. Not only would it take a long time, but the cost to infiltrate a single device would make it very difficult and impractical to recruit a sufficient number of devices to coordinate a DDoS attack using IoT devices.</p>\n<p>Instead of having all the IoT device identities and public keys in a central resource, these can be stored on a distributed ledger and be used to authenticate and verify IoT devices. Through use of a distributed ledger, each service or application provider can host its own node to ensure they have a local copy of the blockchain. More importantly, service providers can mitigate DDoS attacks attempting to disrupt service availability.</p>\n<p>DLT and blockchain have proven their security capabilities over the last ten years. By integrating an IoT device identity and authentications service onto a distributed ledger will help to mitigate many of the known DDoS attack possibilities we have seen to date.</p>\n<p><strong>ATIS Distributed Ledger Project.</strong><br />\nIn 2017, ATIS launched the <a href=""https://www.atis.org/initiatives/distributed-ledger-technology/"">DLT Initiative</a> to validate key aspects of distributed ledger technology as applied to real-world challenges facing today’s communications industry. As part of this work, ATIS generated a technical report, “<a href=""https://www.atis.org/resources/enterprise-identity-on-distributed-ledger-for-authenticated-caller-use-cases/"" rel=""noopener"" target=""_blank"">Enterprise Identity on Distributed Ledger for Authenticated Caller Use Cases</a>.” It describes how DLT will provide enterprise identity verification to authenticate the originating caller information in IP communication networks. The report also addresses problems associated with attestation of a telephone number (TN) due to enterprise multihoming with originating service providers that are not the allocation provider of the TN, within IP communication networks. The solution is called the “<strong>ATIS Enterprise Identity Network</strong>,” and you can access a brief and engaging video clip on its benefits to stakeholders <a href=""https://www.atis.org/initiatives/distributed-ledger-technology/"">here</a>.</p>\n<p>The same DLT-based TN Identity service could also support IoT identities to be authenticated by communication service providers, enterprise verticals and applications providers.

The TRACED Act calls for the FCC to require providers of voice services within 18 months (June 30, 2021) to:</p>\n<ul>\n<li>Implement the STIR/SHAKEN authentication framework in the internet protocol networks of the provider of voice service; and</li>\n<li>Take reasonable measures to implement an effective call authentication framework in the provider’s non-internet protocol (i.e., TDM) networks.</li>\n</ul>\n<p>The recently formed\xa0<a href=""https://www.atis.org/initiatives/non-ip-taskforce/"">Non-IP Call Authentication Task Force (NIPCA TF)</a>, part of ATIS’\xa0<a href=""https://www.atis.org/01_committ_forums/ptsc/"">Packet Technologies and Systems Committee (PTSC)</a>, will focus on the second requirement, addressing the implementation of call authentication in non-internet protocol networks.</p>\n<p>Why is this necessary?</p>\n<p>There remains a significant portion of the voice network that is not capable of initiating, maintaining and terminating SIP calls, and as a result is not able to authenticate or verify calls under the SHAKEN framework.\xa0 Based on the most recently issued\xa0<a href=""https://www.fcc.gov/voice-telephone-services-report"">Voice Telephone Services Report from the FCC</a>\xa0(issued March 2020 for data through 12/31/2018 DOC-362882A1) – approximately 40 percent of voice circuits remain non-IP based. In addition, SHAKEN requires that calls be IP end-to-end, and cannot be used if any portion of the call path is non-IP.</p>\n<p>The TRACED Act implicitly recognizes this challenge, allowing for a potential extension to the deadlines if they create undue hardship for voice service providers that use TDM network technology. However, the TRACED Act still requires voice service providers to take “reasonable measures” to implement an effective Caller ID authentication framework in non-IP portions of their networks.\xa0 This is an important statement in that the “reasonable measures” clause may be satisfied only if the voice service provider is actively working to implement a Caller ID authentication framework on the non-IP portions of its network by either upgrading to IP so that STIR/SHAKEN may be implemented or by working to develop a non-IP authentication mechanism.\xa0 Participation in ATIS’ NIPCA TF can satisfy this requirement. Through it, service providers can demonstrate that they are actively working to address call authentication challenges.</p>\n<p>The NIPCA TF leverages ATIS’ deep technical expertise and proven ability to develop communications standards. ATIS has been at the forefront of call authentication initiatives through the joint ATIS/SIP Forum IP-NNI Task Force. In this role, it brings critical expertise to this initiative, including call authentication standards for IP networks, a deep understanding of TDM network standards, and an ability to bring these two areas together to assess call authentication options in non-IP networks.</p>\n<p>In a very short period, the ATIS NIPCA Task Force has formed and undertaken the development of a technical report regarding alternatives for caller authentication for non-IP traffic and has already received a number of proposals for Call Authentication Frameworks for TDM networks providing the basis for a robust technical program.</p>\n<p>The ATIS NIPCA TF welcomes and encourages all interested parties (including non-ATIS members) to participate.\xa0 The goals of the Task Force are to:\xa0 1) Understand the problems and challenges; 2) Educate TDM experts on call authentication; 3) Investigate the feasibility of TDM call authentication frameworks, including how these would interwork with SHAKEN; and 4) Evaluate the viability of implementing proposed call authentication mechanisms for TDM networks.\xa0\xa0<a href=""https://www.atis.org/initiatives/non-ip-taskforce/"">Learn more</a>\xa0about the NIPCA TF.</p>\n<p>The post <a href=""https://www.atis.org/the-other-40-of-the-network-atis-addresses-tdm-network-call-authentication/"" rel=""nofollow"">The Other 40% of the Network: ATIS Addresses TDM Network Call Authentication</a> appeared first on <a href=""https://www.atis.org"" rel=""nofollow"">ATIS</a>.</p>'}","Sat, 15 Aug 2020 06:00:58 +0000",https://www.atis.org/the-other-40-of-the-network-atis-addresses-tdm-network-call-authentication/?utm_source=rss&utm_medium=rss&utm_campaign=the-other-40-of-the-network-atis-addresses-tdm-network-call-authentication,telecom

This could be as straightforward as remotely monitoring the status of a machine. Alternatively, it might involve the use of technology to update software on a set of digital displays or a fleet of vehicles.</p>\n<p>The nature of each problem determines the technical choices made. For example, an IoT developer might choose the\xa0<a href=""http://www.openmobilealliance.org/wp/OMNA/LwM2M/LwM2MRegistry.html"" rel=""noopener noreferrer"" target=""_blank"">LWM2M protocol</a>\xa0if device management is seen as critical. If they are concerned about low-power connectivity over large distances, they will construct a solution using SigFox or NB-IoT technologies. If payload efficiency is a priority, they might choose between\xa0<a href=""https://coap.technology/"" rel=""noopener noreferrer"" target=""_blank"">CoAP</a>\xa0and\xa0<a href=""https://mqtt.org/"" rel=""noopener noreferrer"" target=""_blank"">MQTT</a>\xa0connectivity protocols. These are some of the technology choices that IoT developers face. It is often simpler to work with an IoT platform whose capabilities represent a toolkit of programmed functions that shield developers from these technology complexities.</p>\n<h3><strong>New Needs and New Tools</strong></h3>\n<p>After some time in service, the expectations of an IoT system are likely to evolve. There might be a need for more functionality. This could involve linking two or more IoT solutions to enable a new way of using data, possibly crossing departmental boundaries. In this situation, complexity depends on whether the two-silo solutions use common conventions, which makes interoperability possible. This depends on how device and application identities are managed, for example, and whether a translation gateway is required between domains. Yet another interoperability requirement might involve a procedure where one IoT solution notifies another when an action is triggered by some application logic.</p>\n<p>IoT platforms eliminate many of these issues in situations where different IoT solutions use the same platform. However, matters get complicated if IoT solutions use different platforms. This can arise in the case of several related participants in an extended supply chain.</p>\n<p>Of course, platform providers can add new capabilities to address new needs over time. However, this can be costly on a one-off basis. A better strategy is to think in terms of a toolkit of capabilities applied to a framework of IoT devices, gateways, and platform. The platform provider can add new capabilities to the platform over time without redesigning the technology stack. This is analogous to adding new tools to a toolbox as opposed to creating different configurations of a Swiss Army knife for each separate IoT solution.</p>\n<p>To illustrate this concept, consider the case of an IoT solution that requires a set of service functions for device management (e.g. LWM2M), registration (for sensor, device, and application identities) and communications management (to handle a mix of MQTT and HTTPS traffic). Later, the developer might want to enhance the solution by implementing tiered access levels or to customize data privacy policies for different users. After that, there is the possibility of distributing and monetizing IoT data, which will require yet more tools.</p>\n<h3><strong>Common Service Functions</strong></h3>\n<p>While each IoT solution is different, all depend on a set of common service functions (CSFs). These are analogous to tools in the IoT developer’s toolbox. CSFs may reside in IoT platform nodes (i.e. gateways and servers) and serve the purpose of maintaining communications between IoT devices, sensors, and other IoT platforms.</p>\n<p>As systems evolve in complexity, the basic CSF toolkit will continue to grow. This is a requirement that its founders anticipated when they created the\xa0<a href=""https://onem2m.org/"" rel=""noopener noreferrer"" target=""_blank"">oneM2M</a>\xa0standardization organization in 2012. Its members went on to specify an architectural framework for IoT solutions based on middleware technology in the horizontal layer that sits between IoT applications and, lower level devices and communications networks. As illustrated, oneM2M’s middleware technology currently comprises fourteen CSFs.</p>\n<p><img alt="""" class=""aligncenter wp-image-8530"" height=""291"" src=""https://www.atis.org/wp-content/uploads/2020/09/onem2m-common-service-functions.png"" width=""600"" /></p>\n<p>Developers can begin with a subset of CSFs from the toolkit to solve the initial deployment challenges of launching an IoT solution. Later on, they can introduce other CSFs progressively as they add data discovery, semantic interoperability, usage charging, and other capabilities to their solutions.</p>\n<h3><strong>The Role of oneM2M CSFs in Enabling Key Business Processes</strong></h3>\n<p>Data marketplaces are emerging as an important class of IoT systems in several IoT industry verticals. The intention is to share IoT data among several ecosystem partners and to support multiple use cases, not just one, via a horizontal architecture that provides a common and scalable environment. There, owners of connected assets can supply IoT data to developers who consume data. Data consumers are less interested in deploying sensors and care more about building IoT applications to solve business and operational problems.</p>\n<p>In the context of connected vehicles, mobility services or smart region initiatives, data marketplaces allow cities and other users of the transportation network to share data under controlled conditions. That establishes the foundation for a wide variety of smart city and intelligent transport solutions. Examples include congestion management, intelligent use of parking resources, coordination of incidents with traffic police, and mobility services that involve connected and autonomous vehicles. Such use cases are typical of the business-process and technical issues that cities are grappling with and exploring through the\xa0<a href=""https://www.atis.org/scde/"" rel=""noopener noreferrer"" target=""_blank"">ATIS Smart Cities Data Exchange initiative</a>.</p>\n<p>The horizontal platform approach takes the form of simple architecture based on oneM2M standards. As illustrated, the foundation contains the oneM2M Service Layer and a set of CSFs to manage IoT data from a range of transport data assets. The next layer exposes raw and value-added data, derived from the application of transportation analytics, to data consumers. These data consumers then develop applications such as for travel planning, parking, and other services in the uppermost layer.</p>\n<h3><strong>Business Processes and oneM2M Capabilities to Enable a Transportation Data Marketplace</strong></h3>\n<p><img alt="""" class=""aligncenter wp-image-8531"" height=""338"" src=""https://www.atis.org/wp-content/uploads/2020/09/onem2m-business-processes.png"" width=""600"" /></p>\n<p>Within the oneM2M Service Layer, the first key business process is to manage data from different sources. This uses the Data Management &amp; Repository CSF and the standardized oneM2M information model. Together, they provide a common framework to store diverse types of static and time-series data. The second CSF that supports data management is the Discovery CSF which enables applications to query and easily discover data from various types of devices in the system. The third CSF that supports data management is the Subscription &amp; Notification CSF. It enables applications to subscribe to events of interest such as a threshold to indicate that traffic congestion has reached a certain level.</p>\n<p>A second business process is to establish and manage service subscription accounts. This uses the Registration CSF which allows a system administrator to associate policies that define the identity and lifetime of a service subscription. The third key business process is to enable the data marketplace operator to apply policy controls to manage access to the system.\xa0 The Registration and Security CSFs provide control over individual user subscriptions in terms of how many resources they can create and how much data they can upload. Such usage statistics are one element in the process of monetizing data via the Service Charging and Accounting CSF.</p>\n<h3><strong>Roadmap for New IoT Capabilities</strong></h3>\n<p>Since the publication of its Release 1 standards, oneM2M members have continued to\xa0<a href=""https://onem2m.org/membership/list-of-deployments"" rel=""noopener noreferrer"" target=""_blank"">develop and deploy its technical capabilities</a>.

Because DNS is such a critical network function, its robustness and security are of profound importance. Important changes to the security of DNS protocols are now underway. These will have an impact on all organizations that offer DNS services or depend on features implemented in DNS.</p>\n<p>Almost all Internet applications rely on DNS to allow the client to find the required server and obtain other information related to the domain. Currently, a large majority (approximately 80%) of DNS queries in public networks are handled by the user’s Internet Service Provider (ISP). This allows ISPs to use DNS to fulfill operational needs and offer services. In managed private networks belonging to enterprises and other organizations (e.g., schools) users often connect to dedicated DNS services that offer special enterprise services including network security services and private network name-spaces.</p>\n<p>Today, most DNS signaling is sent using protocols that do not support security provisions, presenting both privacy and security risks for users. As such, new protocols have been specified that implement cryptographic DNS security and data confidentiality. Support for these is now being introduced in client software (primarily web browsers) and in DNS servers.</p>\n<p>These changes in DNS technology and implementation practices are now creating both challenges and opportunities.</p>\n<p>The IETF has standardized protocols for the use of encrypted DNS: DNS over HTTPS (DoH) and DNS over TLS (DoT). These technologies can enhance the security of DNS protocol, however, the method for how to deploy and operationalize these protocols is largely undefined. As such, browsers and mobile operating systems are using a variety of different approaches that could dramatically change the Internet architecture and have marked impacts on important DNS-based features. While the use of DoT and DoH can have benefits for user security and privacy, the current piecemeal deployments raise complex issues for many stakeholders. Both organizational and technical responses are needed to address these.</p>\n<p>DoT and DoH have similar cryptographic security properties, but the different encapsulation protocols have implications for system design. DoT can give networks some insight into DNS traffic, while DNS over DoH is stealthier and emphasizes privacy (e.g., to cope with environments where the user does not trust the local network).\xa0 Although user data is secured in both protocols, network administrators may view this as a network security vs. privacy conundrum.</p>\n<p>Despite the fact that the implementation of DNS security protocols can have a range of positive benefits, it can also conflict with important network services that are currently widely implemented based on DNS. These services include techniques to mitigate malware and fulfill legal obligations placed on network operators. DoH has particular security implications as it is designed to be resistant to simple approaches for policy enforcement and monitoring in the network.</p>\n<p>A recently released ATIS report,\xa0<a href=""https://www.atis.org/resources/technical-impacts-of-dns-privacy-and-security-on-network-service-scenarios/""><em>Technical Impacts of DNS Privacy and Security on Network Service Scenarios</em></a><em>,</em>\xa0describes the technical impacts of DNS security protocols in a range of network scenarios and identifies impacts on systems in three main areas:</p>\n<ol>\n<li>The absence of industry norms for how to deploy and operationalize encrypted DNS in servers and clients is leading to the adoption of piecemeal solutions that differ in each implementation.</li>\n<li>By selecting their own DNS servers, some clients are disregarding DNS server provisioning information received from the network (e.g., in Dynamic Host Configuration Protocol). These clients can be disruptive to a range of network services, including security and legally required services, that are implemented in ISP and managed private network DNS servers today.</li>\n<li>Implementations of network security features (e.g., malware detection and blocking) as well as the implementation of national legal requirements in public networks and network policy controls in managed private networks could be affected. This is because support of confidentiality in DoT and DoH may prevent operation of any network services implemented in “middle boxes” that rely on DNS queries and responses being in clear text.</li>\n</ol>\n<p><a href=""https://www.atis.org/resources/technical-impacts-of-dns-privacy-and-security-on-network-service-scenarios/""><em>Technical Impacts of DNS Privacy and Security on Network Service Scenarios</em></a>\xa0presents scenarios that illustrate some of the different contexts in which DNS may be used, with each scenario presenting different considerations for DoT and DoH deployment. These scenarios should be used to guide decision-making by clients and servers deploying DoT and DoH. They can also be used by organizations impacted by DoT and DoH to help formulate their strategy.</p>\n<p>The report also contains a set of talking points which ISPs, as well as other parties, can use to communicate about these topics to end users, enterprise network administrators and internal stakeholders. Finally, it provides key recommendations for different stakeholders to encourage collaboration among all stakeholders to create technical standards and best practices for the deployment of DoT and DoH. The goal is to maximize the benefits of DNS security support while reducing problem areas.

Yet these varying requirements present service providers with new challenges, requiring the underlying network infrastructure to meet a variety of different functionality and performance requirements.</p>\n\n\n\n<p>A key element in making all this happen is the ability of 5G to adapt network resources in both the user plane and the control plane to meet the performance levels of each service and device. Network slicing has been devised as a way to structure a network to support diverse classes of services in a guaranteed way on the same network.</p>\n\n\n\n<p>By “slicing” the single physical network into multiple, virtual, end-to-end networks, a service provider can software-define the necessary performance criteria – such as speed, security, coverage area, etc. to match the requirements needed by a service using the slice.</p>\n\n\n\n<p>With network slicing, network functions and resources that are specifically tailored to a vertical market’s requirements are logically isolated, creating multiple virtual networks on top of a common shared physical infrastructure.</p>\n\n\n\n<p>At present, network slices are categorized into different types according to the abstraction of characteristics of the services they facilitate. The Third Generation Partnership Project (3GPP) has defined four network slice types; (1) Enhanced Mobile Broadband (eMBB); (2) Ultra-Reliable Low-Latency Communications (URLLC); (3) massive Internet of Things (mIoT); and (4) V2X.</p>\n\n\n\n<p>These slice types are based on the typical characteristics required for use cases and verticals to provide a way for establishing global interoperability for slicing.</p>\n\n\n\n<h2><strong><em>Are more “slices” needed?</em></strong></h2>\n\n\n\n<p>ATIS recently released an innovative new report, <em><a href=""https://access.atis.org/apps/group_public/download.php/51129/ATIS-I-0000075.pdf"" rel=""noreferrer noopener"" target=""_blank"">IoT Categorization: Exploring the Need for Standardizing Additional Network Slices</a></em>, that examines the topic of network slicing.\xa0 Its objective is to identify areas of commonality across IoT devices and applications and examine how these may be grouped into standard network slices to keep service quality consistent across different networks and operators.</p>\n\n\n\n<p>The report considers the network requirements across the multidimensional landscape of IoT devices and applications to identify if any additional network slice types may be defined to ensure consistent service quality across operators.</p>\n\n\n\n<p>While existing IoT initiatives take an application-centric approach, often from the perspective of a single application or industry vertical, ATIS’ IoT Categorization Initiative examines IoT from a network-centric perspective to determine an effective way to categorize IoT into a small number of meaningful categories based on device types, applications, services, or a combination of these; as well as business, technology, and regulatory implications.</p>\n\n\n\n<p>To provide structure for the analysis, the major IoT application groups are identified and decomposed into further use cases along with the IoT devices used.\xa0 Key performance characteristics that influence network slice requirements are identified. Each application/IoT device grouping is mapped to a network slice, highlighting any areas that may warrant a new slice type. The resulting “living” IoT Categorization Matrix forms the basis for identifying areas of commonality that can be used to determine if additional network slice types are needed to support the varied IoT applications and devices that will connect to the network.</p>\n\n\n\n<p>Standardized definitions for the most commonly used slice types provide a mechanism for enabling roaming, as well as global interoperability for network slicing across network operators.</p>\n\n\n\n<p>Through IoT Categorization, a smaller subset of the applications and devices were found to exhibit characteristics across multiple slices that were not a perfect match to the currently defined four standardized slice types. \xa0This has resulted in the recommendation for consideration of an additional standardized slice type to address the performance requirements for this subset, which encompasses use cases across industrial automation, robotic surgery, and public safety.</p>\n\n\n\n<p>The proposed new network slice type, High-Performance Machine-Type Communications (HMTC), would be defined by the key performance characteristics common to the applications in the above subset, including low latency, high availability, and high data rates. Although similar to the characteristics of the newly defined V2X slice, no mobility or sidelink is required.</p>\n\n\n\n<p>5G is envisioned to support a wide range of IoT verticals with a diverse set of performance and service requirements. Network slicing is a key component of the 5G architecture, enabling network operators to expand their customer base and offer new, differentiated services. Through network slicing, operators can allocate their network resources based on a precise set of performance requirements. Defining a sufficient number of standardized network slice types is essential as customers will expect the same level of service no matter where they are. With the addition of the recommended HMTC slice definition, the resulting standardized slice types should address the most commonly used services and associated performance characteristics. Providing this broader set of standard slice types ensures roaming support, as well as global interoperability for network slicing across network operators. In sum, it is part of what it will take to help 5G reach its potential.</p>\n<p>The post <a href=""https://www.atis.org/iot-categorization-exploring-the-need-for-standardizing-additional-network-slices/"" rel=""nofollow"">IOT Categorization: Exploring the Need for Standardizing Additional Network Slices</a> appeared first on <a href=""https://www.atis.org"" rel=""nofollow"">ATIS</a>.</p>'}","Fri, 03 Jan 2020 01:00:36 +0000",https://www.atis.org/iot-categorization-exploring-the-need-for-standardizing-additional-network-slices/?utm_source=rss&utm_medium=rss&utm_campaign=iot-categorization-exploring-the-need-for-standardizing-additional-network-slices,telecom

Why is one especially critical — particularly as it applies to semi- and fully autonomous vehicles?</em></strong></p>\n\n\n\n<p>Collaborative Cybersecurity is an essential, disruptive, and logical model to enable the introduction of autonomous vehicles on our roads in the safest manner possible.\xa0All industries, and not just the vehicle original equipment manufacturers (OEMs), need to turn the current cybersecurity model on its head.\xa0Governments and commercial organizations alike need to rethink how cybersecurity should work for them to better position themselves against the growing number of threats.\xa0Cybersecurity companies who develop solutions need to reconsider how to increase the value of their product offer by re-imagining their delivery model via cooperation and collaboration both horizontally and vertically. It can no longer be about delivering standalone solutions from individual companies leaving the customers to integrate all these. Here’s why:</p>\n\n\n\n<h2><strong>The “Current” Cybersecurity Model</strong></h2>\n\n\n\n<div class=""wp-block-columns has-2-columns"">\n<div class=""wp-block-column"">\n<p>The current cybersecurity model for vehicle OEMs, and pretty much any other large organization attempting to protect its products and services and internal systems, follows the typical methodology of:</p>\n\n\n\n<ol>\n<li>Research available cybersecurity technologies in the market from various companies as they pertain to their industry/company’s products and services, and internal systems</li>\n<li>Determine which technologies can address which specific cybersecurity problems</li>\n<li>Do some assessments of targeted technologies which seem most promising</li>\n<li>Acquire some of the targeted technologies to integrate within their internal IT processes and for protecting their products and services</li>\n<li>Maximize the use of each technology based on its features and functionality</li>\n<li>Attempt to stitch together these various disparate cybersecurity technologies to create a more unified holistic view and interpretation of the data to discover and act on threats</li>\n<li>Deal with the myriad of updates/upgrades and product overhauls for each cybersecurity technology acquired. Attempt once again to retain a cohesive, integrated security solution, and in parallel attempt to maintain some of the automated processes you had achieved with the earlier versions of these cybersecurity products</li>\n<li>Deal with replacing a product outright when the licensing scheme simply gets too expensive or when the product becomes much less effective compared to others</li>\n<li>Train, train, and retrain your cybersecurity staff to stay on top of all the above</li>\n<li>Retain the services of cybersecurity consultants to assist internal staff in dealing with the onslaught of dealing with all of the above</li>\n</ol>\n\n\n\n<p>&nbsp;</p>\n</div>\n\n\n\n<div class=""wp-block-column"">\n<h4>Securing the Modern Vehicle</h4>\n\n\n\n<p>Findings from a 2018 study by the Ponemon Institute “<a href=""https://www.sae.org/binaries/content/assets/cm/content/topics/cybersecurity/securing_the_modern_vehicle.pdf"" rel=""noreferrer noopener"" target=""_blank"">Securing the Modern Vehicle</a>” shows the precarious position that both vehicle OEMs and their suppliers find themselves.</p>\n\n\n\n<ul>\n<li>84% of respondents in this study have concerns that cybersecurity practices are not keeping pace with evolving technologies</li>\n<li>30% of vehicle OEMs and suppliers combined do not have an established product cybersecurity program or team</li>\n<li>41% of automotive suppliers alone do not have an established product cybersecurity program or team</li>\n<li>63% of respondents test less than half of hardware, software, and other technologies for vulnerabilities</li>\n<li>52% of respondents in the study are aware of potential harm to drivers of vehicles because of insecure automotive technologies, whether developed by third parties or by their organizations</li>\n</ul>\n\n\n\n<figure class=""wp-block-image""><a href=""https://www.sae.org/binaries/content/assets/cm/content/topics/cybersecurity/securing_the_modern_vehicle.pdf"" rel=""noreferrer noopener"" target=""_blank""><img alt="""" class=""wp-image-1967"" src=""https://sites.atis.org/wp-content/uploads/2019/12/securing_the_modern_vehicle_Page_01-791x1024.jpg"" /></a></figure>\n</div>\n</div>\n\n\n\n<p>The cycle is never-ending with little to show for other than <em>attempting </em>to keep up with rapidly increasing and adaptive threats. This model also makes it impossible for organizations to achieve their cybersecurity goals since in the end, constant requests for added funding, time, and resources cannot be met.\xa0</p>\n\n\n\n<h2><strong>The Collaborative Cybersecurity Model</strong></h2>\n\n\n\n<p>In contrast to the current model, the Collective Cybersecurity Model is all about collaborating with participating cybersecurity companies, vehicle OEMs and their suppliers, sharing and exchanging cybersecurity-related information in a continuous real-time manner.\xa0From a high level, when signing on to this model, no partner keeps any information to itself and or waits to share information.\xa0Once information is shared, the partners work together to address the issue as one company.\xa0This way, vehicle OEMs will interact with, a single entity — not four or five different cybersecurity companies.\xa0It’s that simple.\xa0</p>\n\n\n\n<p>The key concepts are “share and exchange” and “continuous real-time.” Threat related information is always made available to all partners for analysis and action when and/or if necessary.\xa0Not only is the threat info shared, but so is the evolving analysis of the threat as well as any required actions to counter it.</p>\n\n\n\n<p>As part of the three-plus years of research ATIS has conducted on <a href=""https://www.atis.org/01_strat_init/connectedcar/"" rel=""noreferrer noopener"" target=""_blank"">Collaborative Cybersecurity</a>, working with the various cybersecurity companies, it is undeniable that every industry needs to revamp its current cybersecurity model. Industries should move to a model that is collaborative at its very roots. A collaborative model will produce the most effective and timely information and provide the best overall protection against the gambit of cyber threats that continue to evolve and grow.</p>\n\n\n\n<h2><strong>Key Elements </strong></h2>\n\n\n\n<p>The Collaborative Cybersecurity model is defined by five Key Elements which consist of the following:</p>\n\n\n\n<ol>\n<li>Threat Intelligence</li>\n<li>Hardware Security</li>\n<li>Software Security</li>\n<li>Network Security</li>\n<li>Cloud Security</li>\n</ol>\n\n\n\n<p>Outlined below are some examples of the high-level functional requirements that fall under each of the Key Elements.\xa0\xa0The functions listed below are by no means exhaustive but serve as a guide as to what one would expect to see under each pillar.\xa0\xa0</p>\n\n\n\n<figure class=""wp-block-image""><img alt="""" class=""wp-image-1959"" src=""https://sites.atis.org/wp-content/uploads/2019/12/collaborative-cybersecurity-model-1024x599.jpg"" /></figure>\n\n\n\n<h2><strong>Conclusions</strong></h2>\n\n\n\n<p>Whenever there is talk of disruptive technology, methods, and processes challenging the Status Quo, there is always a good dose of skepticism.\xa0Some will knock the idea down because it doesn’t fit within their plans. Some will want to protect their interests by retaining the current way of doing business. Even if it is proven to be a failed model to address new cybersecurity problems that keep growing, adapting, and getting smarter faster.\xa0</p>\n\n\n\n<p>Cybersecurity and technology companies need to bring their diverse expertise, experience, and knowledge to the table to showcase the value of a Collaborative Cybersecurity Model for the vehicle OEM industry. If vehicle OEMs cannot demonstrate and develop a coordinated and collaborative cybersecurity strategy to safeguard consumers, governments will likely step in quite vigorously.\xa0Governments may enact specific mandated cybersecurity policies/laws that vehicle OEMs may find expensive and time-consuming to develop, introduce, and support.</p>\n\n\n\n<p>Learn more about the <a href=""https://www.atis.org/01_strat_init/connectedcar/"" rel=""noreferrer noopener"" target=""_blank"">ATIS Connected Vehicle Cybersecurity initiative</a>.</p>\n\n\n\n<p>Read the full post from which this blog is excerpted <a href=""https://www.linkedin.com/pulse/collaborative-cybersecurity-connected-vehicles-denis-niles/"" rel=""noreferrer noopener"" target=""_blank"">here</a>.\xa0 \xa0</p>\n<p>The post <a href=""https://www.atis.org/collaborative-cybersecurity-for-connected-vehicles/"" rel=""nofollow"">Collaborative Cybersecurity for Connected Vehicles</a> appeared first on <a href=""https://www.atis.org"" rel=""nofollow"">ATIS</a>.</p>'}","Tue, 03 Dec 2019 20:35:12 +0000",https://www.atis.org/collaborative-cybersecurity-for-connected-vehicles/?utm_source=rss&utm_medium=rss&utm_campaign=collaborative-cybersecurity-for-connected-vehicles,telecom

But what comes next on the horizon in terms of the future of mobile technology? To answer this question, research and development initiatives have already started in multiple countries and regions around the globe to work on the next generation in the evolution of mobile:\xa0 6G. Although the 6G vision is still to be defined, it is expected that the next generation of mobile technology will build on the capabilities of more bandwidth, lower latency, additional spectrum and greater reliability, 6G is expected to apply new cognitive, predictive and contextual capabilities to deliver a yet-to-be-imagined level of user experience.</p>\n<p>As such, it is a strategic imperative that North America establish itself as the global leader in the ideas, development, adoption and rapid commercialization of 6G, while continuing to work with global partners in areas like standards leadership to assure a broad marketplace for 6G solutions. ATIS has established the <a href=""https://nextgalliance.org/"">Next G Alliance</a> to provide the foundation for North America to develop a 6G national roadmap and set of research priorities. The goal is that these not only spur development and innovation but ultimately drive economic growth and commercialization success for the entire region. By leveraging the knowledge gained from the development and early deployments of 5G, the North America market is well positioned to advance mobile technology leadership in 6G and beyond.</p>\n<p>The Next G Alliance is a collaborative effort across industry and academia that will encompass the full lifecycle of research and development, manufacturing, standardization, market readiness and commercialization of 6G. It was born out of ATIS’ <a href=""https://www.atis.org/wp-content/uploads/2020/07/Promoting-US-Leadership-on-Path-to-6G.pdf"">Call to Action</a> issued in May 2020 to extend the benefits of 5G commercialization within the U.S. to a 6G world that delivers innovative services and customer experiences beyond network boundaries, physical environments and geographic constraints. The Call to Action identifies a proposed list of core Next G technologies as well as recommendations on government actions to stimulate innovation and development. Building on the Call to Action, the key strategic actions of the Next G Alliance are to:</p>\n<ul>\n<li>Create a 6G national roadmap that will promote a vibrant marketplace for 6G introduction, adoption and commercialization with U.S. innovation in mind</li>\n<li>Develop a set of national priorities that will influence government applied research funding and promote incentivized government actions</li>\n<li>Progress a North American model that promotes development across the full lifecycle of research to realization, aligned with commercialization outcomes</li>\n</ul>\n<p>Who is setting this strategy into action? The Next G Alliance encourages participation across all stakeholders in the mobile industry, including mobility service providers; ICT industry companies; network systems providers, operations and business software providers; start-ups; industry vertical companies as well as other industry association partners. Being a member of the Next G Alliance does not require participants to be a member of ATIS.</p>\n<p>Beyond the enablement of applications that exceed any previous generation of mobile technology, 6G will further change the way data is created, processed and consumed. This may spur new business models, forms of data ownership, and related policies. The Next G Alliance’s work will position a range of entities, including operators, resource brokers, services and application providers as well as trust and security providers to reap the benefits of a 6G economy.</p>\n<p>The path to this future will undoubtedly present new challenges but also the potential for exciting new opportunities for both existing and new participants.

Over the last few years, we have seen IT and telecommunications services evolve from dedicated centralized infrastructure, where today these are deployed across distributed virtualized cloud providers. In doing so, the traditional controls for managing identity, security and data privacy can present many challenges.</p>\n<p><strong>The growing threat of IoT-based cyberattacks</strong><br />\nThe plethora of innovative low-cost internet of things (IoT) devices that typically ship with default security passwords are connecting with a broad range of IT services. As IoT adoption grows, hackers see new opportunities to spread malicious software to millions of IoT devices, which can then be leveraged in a coordinated distributed denial-of-service (DDoS) attack.</p>\n<p>We have seen many examples in the news where centralized systems are compromised through these attacks. A DDoS attack floods systems, servers or networks with traffic to exhaust resources and bandwidth. As a result, the system is unable to fulfill legitimate requests. Attackers can also use multiple compromised devices to launch this attack.</p>\n<p>Today, most IT security systems are based on central servers, used to identify and authenticate individual connecting IoT devices. Any centralization makes servers inherently vulnerable to potential DDoS and brute force attacks. If this centralized resource is compromised, everything attached and the service it provides will be equally affected.</p>\n<p>In 2016, in possibly the most severe example of this, there was an attack on the internet DNS service provider Dyn. In this attack, millions of internet digital cameras and DVR players were infected with special malware, known as a “botnet.” The cameras were coordinated into bombarding a server with traffic until it collapsed under the strain. The result brought down the internet across North America, affecting top internet-based brands, including Airbnb, Twitter, PayPal and Netflix.</p>\n<p><strong>Distributed ledger security foundations</strong><br />\nDistributed ledger technologies or blockchain, as they are commonly referred to, are currently being used to power and secure a cryptocurrency market worth over US <a href=""https://coinmarketcap.com/"">$368 billion</a> as of September 2020.</p>\n<p>DLT/blockchain is a truly distributed system, which has built-in protections against many potential cybersecurity and fraud attacks. The largest blockchain network today, Bitcoin, has more than 100,000 nodes. In 10 years of operation, its protocol has warded off several attempts made to attack this network. This distributed infrastructure of nodes makes it extremely difficult for a successful cyberattack. Multiple blockchain nodes across many different institutions must be attacked to overwhelm the full system.</p>\n<p>A distributed ledger foundation for secure access and transactions is based on cryptography functions from public-key cryptography. The system uses asymmetric cryptography, also known as public-key cryptography, using public and private keys to encrypt and decrypt data. The keys are simply large numbers that have been paired together but are not identical, referred to as “asymmetric keys.”</p>\n<p>One key kept secret is called the private key. The private key is used to encrypt messages and ensure the identity of the owner recording information or transacting on the blockchain can be trusted. The other key is called the public key. The public key is used to verify that the message sent is from the holder of a specific private key. Public keys are distributed on the distributed ledger blockchain enabling anyone to use them to verify the identity and authenticity of a message or transaction. This method eliminates the need for personal data, i.e., username/password, to be used as a means of authenticated access.</p>\n<p><strong>How distributed ledger technology can enhance IoT security</strong><br />\nBillions of IoT devices are being produced and shipped to consumers globally. Typically, manufacturers configure into the firmware default usernames/passwords enabling the devices to be shipped anywhere and be easily installed.</p>\n<p>Instead, the manufacturers of these IoT devices can embed into the firmware a unique private key for each IoT device, storing each device identity with its corresponding public key onto a distributed ledger. The use of these unique keys gives each IoT device its own unique trusted identity that can be authenticated by any application using the public key from the distributed ledger.</p>\n<p>Most distributed ledger/blockchain private keys use SHA256 hashing to secure transactions. In broad terms, a supercomputer that can perform 15 trillion calculations per second employed in cracking a hash would take more than a billion years to crack the hash of a single blockchain identity. Not only would it take a long time, but the cost to infiltrate a single device would make it very difficult and impractical to recruit a sufficient number of devices to coordinate a DDoS attack using IoT devices.</p>\n<p>Instead of having all the IoT device identities and public keys in a central resource, these can be stored on a distributed ledger and be used to authenticate and verify IoT devices. Through use of a distributed ledger, each service or application provider can host its own node to ensure they have a local copy of the blockchain. More importantly, service providers can mitigate DDoS attacks attempting to disrupt service availability.</p>\n<p>DLT and blockchain have proven their security capabilities over the last ten years. By integrating an IoT device identity and authentications service onto a distributed ledger will help to mitigate many of the known DDoS attack possibilities we have seen to date.</p>\n<p><strong>ATIS Distributed Ledger Project.</strong><br />\nIn 2017, ATIS launched the <a href=""https://www.atis.org/initiatives/distributed-ledger-technology/"">DLT Initiative</a> to validate key aspects of distributed ledger technology as applied to real-world challenges facing today’s communications industry. As part of this work, ATIS generated a technical report, “<a href=""https://www.atis.org/resources/enterprise-identity-on-distributed-ledger-for-authenticated-caller-use-cases/"" rel=""noopener"" target=""_blank"">Enterprise Identity on Distributed Ledger for Authenticated Caller Use Cases</a>.” It describes how DLT will provide enterprise identity verification to authenticate the originating caller information in IP communication networks. The report also addresses problems associated with attestation of a telephone number (TN) due to enterprise multihoming with originating service providers that are not the allocation provider of the TN, within IP communication networks. The solution is called the “<strong>ATIS Enterprise Identity Network</strong>,” and you can access a brief and engaging video clip on its benefits to stakeholders <a href=""https://www.atis.org/initiatives/distributed-ledger-technology/"">here</a>.</p>\n<p>The same DLT-based TN Identity service could also support IoT identities to be authenticated by communication service providers, enterprise verticals and applications providers.

The TRACED Act calls for the FCC to require providers of voice services within 18 months (June 30, 2021) to:</p>\n<ul>\n<li>Implement the STIR/SHAKEN authentication framework in the internet protocol networks of the provider of voice service; and</li>\n<li>Take reasonable measures to implement an effective call authentication framework in the provider’s non-internet protocol (i.e., TDM) networks.</li>\n</ul>\n<p>The recently formed\xa0<a href=""https://www.atis.org/initiatives/non-ip-taskforce/"">Non-IP Call Authentication Task Force (NIPCA TF)</a>, part of ATIS’\xa0<a href=""https://www.atis.org/01_committ_forums/ptsc/"">Packet Technologies and Systems Committee (PTSC)</a>, will focus on the second requirement, addressing the implementation of call authentication in non-internet protocol networks.</p>\n<p>Why is this necessary?</p>\n<p>There remains a significant portion of the voice network that is not capable of initiating, maintaining and terminating SIP calls, and as a result is not able to authenticate or verify calls under the SHAKEN framework.\xa0 Based on the most recently issued\xa0<a href=""https://www.fcc.gov/voice-telephone-services-report"">Voice Telephone Services Report from the FCC</a>\xa0(issued March 2020 for data through 12/31/2018 DOC-362882A1) – approximately 40 percent of voice circuits remain non-IP based. In addition, SHAKEN requires that calls be IP end-to-end, and cannot be used if any portion of the call path is non-IP.</p>\n<p>The TRACED Act implicitly recognizes this challenge, allowing for a potential extension to the deadlines if they create undue hardship for voice service providers that use TDM network technology. However, the TRACED Act still requires voice service providers to take “reasonable measures” to implement an effective Caller ID authentication framework in non-IP portions of their networks.\xa0 This is an important statement in that the “reasonable measures” clause may be satisfied only if the voice service provider is actively working to implement a Caller ID authentication framework on the non-IP portions of its network by either upgrading to IP so that STIR/SHAKEN may be implemented or by working to develop a non-IP authentication mechanism.\xa0 Participation in ATIS’ NIPCA TF can satisfy this requirement. Through it, service providers can demonstrate that they are actively working to address call authentication challenges.</p>\n<p>The NIPCA TF leverages ATIS’ deep technical expertise and proven ability to develop communications standards. ATIS has been at the forefront of call authentication initiatives through the joint ATIS/SIP Forum IP-NNI Task Force. In this role, it brings critical expertise to this initiative, including call authentication standards for IP networks, a deep understanding of TDM network standards, and an ability to bring these two areas together to assess call authentication options in non-IP networks.</p>\n<p>In a very short period, the ATIS NIPCA Task Force has formed and undertaken the development of a technical report regarding alternatives for caller authentication for non-IP traffic and has already received a number of proposals for Call Authentication Frameworks for TDM networks providing the basis for a robust technical program.</p>\n<p>The ATIS NIPCA TF welcomes and encourages all interested parties (including non-ATIS members) to participate.\xa0 The goals of the Task Force are to:\xa0 1) Understand the problems and challenges; 2) Educate TDM experts on call authentication; 3) Investigate the feasibility of TDM call authentication frameworks, including how these would interwork with SHAKEN; and 4) Evaluate the viability of implementing proposed call authentication mechanisms for TDM networks.\xa0\xa0<a href=""https://www.atis.org/initiatives/non-ip-taskforce/"">Learn more</a>\xa0about the NIPCA TF.</p>\n<p>The post <a href=""https://www.atis.org/the-other-40-of-the-network-atis-addresses-tdm-network-call-authentication/"" rel=""nofollow"">The Other 40% of the Network: ATIS Addresses TDM Network Call Authentication</a> appeared first on <a href=""https://www.atis.org"" rel=""nofollow"">ATIS</a>.</p>'}","Sat, 15 Aug 2020 06:00:58 +0000",https://www.atis.org/the-other-40-of-the-network-atis-addresses-tdm-network-call-authentication/?utm_source=rss&utm_medium=rss&utm_campaign=the-other-40-of-the-network-atis-addresses-tdm-network-call-authentication,telecom

This could be as straightforward as remotely monitoring the status of a machine. Alternatively, it might involve the use of technology to update software on a set of digital displays or a fleet of vehicles.</p>\n<p>The nature of each problem determines the technical choices made. For example, an IoT developer might choose the\xa0<a href=""http://www.openmobilealliance.org/wp/OMNA/LwM2M/LwM2MRegistry.html"" rel=""noopener noreferrer"" target=""_blank"">LWM2M protocol</a>\xa0if device management is seen as critical. If they are concerned about low-power connectivity over large distances, they will construct a solution using SigFox or NB-IoT technologies. If payload efficiency is a priority, they might choose between\xa0<a href=""https://coap.technology/"" rel=""noopener noreferrer"" target=""_blank"">CoAP</a>\xa0and\xa0<a href=""https://mqtt.org/"" rel=""noopener noreferrer"" target=""_blank"">MQTT</a>\xa0connectivity protocols. These are some of the technology choices that IoT developers face. It is often simpler to work with an IoT platform whose capabilities represent a toolkit of programmed functions that shield developers from these technology complexities.</p>\n<h3><strong>New Needs and New Tools</strong></h3>\n<p>After some time in service, the expectations of an IoT system are likely to evolve. There might be a need for more functionality. This could involve linking two or more IoT solutions to enable a new way of using data, possibly crossing departmental boundaries. In this situation, complexity depends on whether the two-silo solutions use common conventions, which makes interoperability possible. This depends on how device and application identities are managed, for example, and whether a translation gateway is required between domains. Yet another interoperability requirement might involve a procedure where one IoT solution notifies another when an action is triggered by some application logic.</p>\n<p>IoT platforms eliminate many of these issues in situations where different IoT solutions use the same platform. However, matters get complicated if IoT solutions use different platforms. This can arise in the case of several related participants in an extended supply chain.</p>\n<p>Of course, platform providers can add new capabilities to address new needs over time. However, this can be costly on a one-off basis. A better strategy is to think in terms of a toolkit of capabilities applied to a framework of IoT devices, gateways, and platform. The platform provider can add new capabilities to the platform over time without redesigning the technology stack. This is analogous to adding new tools to a toolbox as opposed to creating different configurations of a Swiss Army knife for each separate IoT solution.</p>\n<p>To illustrate this concept, consider the case of an IoT solution that requires a set of service functions for device management (e.g. LWM2M), registration (for sensor, device, and application identities) and communications management (to handle a mix of MQTT and HTTPS traffic). Later, the developer might want to enhance the solution by implementing tiered access levels or to customize data privacy policies for different users. After that, there is the possibility of distributing and monetizing IoT data, which will require yet more tools.</p>\n<h3><strong>Common Service Functions</strong></h3>\n<p>While each IoT solution is different, all depend on a set of common service functions (CSFs). These are analogous to tools in the IoT developer’s toolbox. CSFs may reside in IoT platform nodes (i.e. gateways and servers) and serve the purpose of maintaining communications between IoT devices, sensors, and other IoT platforms.</p>\n<p>As systems evolve in complexity, the basic CSF toolkit will continue to grow. This is a requirement that its founders anticipated when they created the\xa0<a href=""https://onem2m.org/"" rel=""noopener noreferrer"" target=""_blank"">oneM2M</a>\xa0standardization organization in 2012. Its members went on to specify an architectural framework for IoT solutions based on middleware technology in the horizontal layer that sits between IoT applications and, lower level devices and communications networks. As illustrated, oneM2M’s middleware technology currently comprises fourteen CSFs.</p>\n<p><img alt="""" class=""aligncenter wp-image-8530"" height=""291"" src=""https://www.atis.org/wp-content/uploads/2020/09/onem2m-common-service-functions.png"" width=""600"" /></p>\n<p>Developers can begin with a subset of CSFs from the toolkit to solve the initial deployment challenges of launching an IoT solution. Later on, they can introduce other CSFs progressively as they add data discovery, semantic interoperability, usage charging, and other capabilities to their solutions.</p>\n<h3><strong>The Role of oneM2M CSFs in Enabling Key Business Processes</strong></h3>\n<p>Data marketplaces are emerging as an important class of IoT systems in several IoT industry verticals. The intention is to share IoT data among several ecosystem partners and to support multiple use cases, not just one, via a horizontal architecture that provides a common and scalable environment. There, owners of connected assets can supply IoT data to developers who consume data. Data consumers are less interested in deploying sensors and care more about building IoT applications to solve business and operational problems.</p>\n<p>In the context of connected vehicles, mobility services or smart region initiatives, data marketplaces allow cities and other users of the transportation network to share data under controlled conditions. That establishes the foundation for a wide variety of smart city and intelligent transport solutions. Examples include congestion management, intelligent use of parking resources, coordination of incidents with traffic police, and mobility services that involve connected and autonomous vehicles. Such use cases are typical of the business-process and technical issues that cities are grappling with and exploring through the\xa0<a href=""https://www.atis.org/scde/"" rel=""noopener noreferrer"" target=""_blank"">ATIS Smart Cities Data Exchange initiative</a>.</p>\n<p>The horizontal platform approach takes the form of simple architecture based on oneM2M standards. As illustrated, the foundation contains the oneM2M Service Layer and a set of CSFs to manage IoT data from a range of transport data assets. The next layer exposes raw and value-added data, derived from the application of transportation analytics, to data consumers. These data consumers then develop applications such as for travel planning, parking, and other services in the uppermost layer.</p>\n<h3><strong>Business Processes and oneM2M Capabilities to Enable a Transportation Data Marketplace</strong></h3>\n<p><img alt="""" class=""aligncenter wp-image-8531"" height=""338"" src=""https://www.atis.org/wp-content/uploads/2020/09/onem2m-business-processes.png"" width=""600"" /></p>\n<p>Within the oneM2M Service Layer, the first key business process is to manage data from different sources. This uses the Data Management &amp; Repository CSF and the standardized oneM2M information model. Together, they provide a common framework to store diverse types of static and time-series data. The second CSF that supports data management is the Discovery CSF which enables applications to query and easily discover data from various types of devices in the system. The third CSF that supports data management is the Subscription &amp; Notification CSF. It enables applications to subscribe to events of interest such as a threshold to indicate that traffic congestion has reached a certain level.</p>\n<p>A second business process is to establish and manage service subscription accounts. This uses the Registration CSF which allows a system administrator to associate policies that define the identity and lifetime of a service subscription. The third key business process is to enable the data marketplace operator to apply policy controls to manage access to the system.\xa0 The Registration and Security CSFs provide control over individual user subscriptions in terms of how many resources they can create and how much data they can upload. Such usage statistics are one element in the process of monetizing data via the Service Charging and Accounting CSF.</p>\n<h3><strong>Roadmap for New IoT Capabilities</strong></h3>\n<p>Since the publication of its Release 1 standards, oneM2M members have continued to\xa0<a href=""https://onem2m.org/membership/list-of-deployments"" rel=""noopener noreferrer"" target=""_blank"">develop and deploy its technical capabilities</a>.

Because DNS is such a critical network function, its robustness and security are of profound importance. Important changes to the security of DNS protocols are now underway. These will have an impact on all organizations that offer DNS services or depend on features implemented in DNS.</p>\n<p>Almost all Internet applications rely on DNS to allow the client to find the required server and obtain other information related to the domain. Currently, a large majority (approximately 80%) of DNS queries in public networks are handled by the user’s Internet Service Provider (ISP). This allows ISPs to use DNS to fulfill operational needs and offer services. In managed private networks belonging to enterprises and other organizations (e.g., schools) users often connect to dedicated DNS services that offer special enterprise services including network security services and private network name-spaces.</p>\n<p>Today, most DNS signaling is sent using protocols that do not support security provisions, presenting both privacy and security risks for users. As such, new protocols have been specified that implement cryptographic DNS security and data confidentiality. Support for these is now being introduced in client software (primarily web browsers) and in DNS servers.</p>\n<p>These changes in DNS technology and implementation practices are now creating both challenges and opportunities.</p>\n<p>The IETF has standardized protocols for the use of encrypted DNS: DNS over HTTPS (DoH) and DNS over TLS (DoT). These technologies can enhance the security of DNS protocol, however, the method for how to deploy and operationalize these protocols is largely undefined. As such, browsers and mobile operating systems are using a variety of different approaches that could dramatically change the Internet architecture and have marked impacts on important DNS-based features. While the use of DoT and DoH can have benefits for user security and privacy, the current piecemeal deployments raise complex issues for many stakeholders. Both organizational and technical responses are needed to address these.</p>\n<p>DoT and DoH have similar cryptographic security properties, but the different encapsulation protocols have implications for system design. DoT can give networks some insight into DNS traffic, while DNS over DoH is stealthier and emphasizes privacy (e.g., to cope with environments where the user does not trust the local network).\xa0 Although user data is secured in both protocols, network administrators may view this as a network security vs. privacy conundrum.</p>\n<p>Despite the fact that the implementation of DNS security protocols can have a range of positive benefits, it can also conflict with important network services that are currently widely implemented based on DNS. These services include techniques to mitigate malware and fulfill legal obligations placed on network operators. DoH has particular security implications as it is designed to be resistant to simple approaches for policy enforcement and monitoring in the network.</p>\n<p>A recently released ATIS report,\xa0<a href=""https://www.atis.org/resources/technical-impacts-of-dns-privacy-and-security-on-network-service-scenarios/""><em>Technical Impacts of DNS Privacy and Security on Network Service Scenarios</em></a><em>,</em>\xa0describes the technical impacts of DNS security protocols in a range of network scenarios and identifies impacts on systems in three main areas:</p>\n<ol>\n<li>The absence of industry norms for how to deploy and operationalize encrypted DNS in servers and clients is leading to the adoption of piecemeal solutions that differ in each implementation.</li>\n<li>By selecting their own DNS servers, some clients are disregarding DNS server provisioning information received from the network (e.g., in Dynamic Host Configuration Protocol). These clients can be disruptive to a range of network services, including security and legally required services, that are implemented in ISP and managed private network DNS servers today.</li>\n<li>Implementations of network security features (e.g., malware detection and blocking) as well as the implementation of national legal requirements in public networks and network policy controls in managed private networks could be affected. This is because support of confidentiality in DoT and DoH may prevent operation of any network services implemented in “middle boxes” that rely on DNS queries and responses being in clear text.</li>\n</ol>\n<p><a href=""https://www.atis.org/resources/technical-impacts-of-dns-privacy-and-security-on-network-service-scenarios/""><em>Technical Impacts of DNS Privacy and Security on Network Service Scenarios</em></a>\xa0presents scenarios that illustrate some of the different contexts in which DNS may be used, with each scenario presenting different considerations for DoT and DoH deployment. These scenarios should be used to guide decision-making by clients and servers deploying DoT and DoH. They can also be used by organizations impacted by DoT and DoH to help formulate their strategy.</p>\n<p>The report also contains a set of talking points which ISPs, as well as other parties, can use to communicate about these topics to end users, enterprise network administrators and internal stakeholders. Finally, it provides key recommendations for different stakeholders to encourage collaboration among all stakeholders to create technical standards and best practices for the deployment of DoT and DoH. The goal is to maximize the benefits of DNS security support while reducing problem areas. ATIS’ analysis is a major industry contribution toward achieving this.</p>\n<p>The post <a href=""https://www.atis.org/dns-security/"" rel=""nofollow"">DNS Security</a> appeared first on <a href=""https://www.atis.org"" rel=""nofollow"">ATIS</a>.</p>'}","Thu, 23 Apr 2020 16:58:16 +0000",https://www.atis.org/dns-security/?utm_source=rss&utm_medium=rss&utm_campaign=dns-security,telecom

Yet these varying requirements present service providers with new challenges, requiring the underlying network infrastructure to meet a variety of different functionality and performance requirements.</p>\n\n\n\n<p>A key element in making all this happen is the ability of 5G to adapt network resources in both the user plane and the control plane to meet the performance levels of each service and device. Network slicing has been devised as a way to structure a network to support diverse classes of services in a guaranteed way on the same network.</p>\n\n\n\n<p>By “slicing” the single physical network into multiple, virtual, end-to-end networks, a service provider can software-define the necessary performance criteria – such as speed, security, coverage area, etc. to match the requirements needed by a service using the slice.</p>\n\n\n\n<p>With network slicing, network functions and resources that are specifically tailored to a vertical market’s requirements are logically isolated, creating multiple virtual networks on top of a common shared physical infrastructure.</p>\n\n\n\n<p>At present, network slices are categorized into different types according to the abstraction of characteristics of the services they facilitate. The Third Generation Partnership Project (3GPP) has defined four network slice types; (1) Enhanced Mobile Broadband (eMBB); (2) Ultra-Reliable Low-Latency Communications (URLLC); (3) massive Internet of Things (mIoT); and (4) V2X.</p>\n\n\n\n<p>These slice types are based on the typical characteristics required for use cases and verticals to provide a way for establishing global interoperability for slicing.</p>\n\n\n\n<h2><strong><em>Are more “slices” needed?</em></strong></h2>\n\n\n\n<p>ATIS recently released an innovative new report, <em><a href=""https://access.atis.org/apps/group_public/download.php/51129/ATIS-I-0000075.pdf"" rel=""noreferrer noopener"" target=""_blank"">IoT Categorization: Exploring the Need for Standardizing Additional Network Slices</a></em>, that examines the topic of network slicing.\xa0 Its objective is to identify areas of commonality across IoT devices and applications and examine how these may be grouped into standard network slices to keep service quality consistent across different networks and operators.</p>\n\n\n\n<p>The report considers the network requirements across the multidimensional landscape of IoT devices and applications to identify if any additional network slice types may be defined to ensure consistent service quality across operators.</p>\n\n\n\n<p>While existing IoT initiatives take an application-centric approach, often from the perspective of a single application or industry vertical, ATIS’ IoT Categorization Initiative examines IoT from a network-centric perspective to determine an effective way to categorize IoT into a small number of meaningful categories based on device types, applications, services, or a combination of these; as well as business, technology, and regulatory implications.</p>\n\n\n\n<p>To provide structure for the analysis, the major IoT application groups are identified and decomposed into further use cases along with the IoT devices used.\xa0 Key performance characteristics that influence network slice requirements are identified. Each application/IoT device grouping is mapped to a network slice, highlighting any areas that may warrant a new slice type. The resulting “living” IoT Categorization Matrix forms the basis for identifying areas of commonality that can be used to determine if additional network slice types are needed to support the varied IoT applications and devices that will connect to the network.</p>\n\n\n\n<p>Standardized definitions for the most commonly used slice types provide a mechanism for enabling roaming, as well as global interoperability for network slicing across network operators.</p>\n\n\n\n<p>Through IoT Categorization, a smaller subset of the applications and devices were found to exhibit characteristics across multiple slices that were not a perfect match to the currently defined four standardized slice types. \xa0This has resulted in the recommendation for consideration of an additional standardized slice type to address the performance requirements for this subset, which encompasses use cases across industrial automation, robotic surgery, and public safety.</p>\n\n\n\n<p>The proposed new network slice type, High-Performance Machine-Type Communications (HMTC), would be defined by the key performance characteristics common to the applications in the above subset, including low latency, high availability, and high data rates. Although similar to the characteristics of the newly defined V2X slice, no mobility or sidelink is required.</p>\n\n\n\n<p>5G is envisioned to support a wide range of IoT verticals with a diverse set of performance and service requirements. Network slicing is a key component of the 5G architecture, enabling network operators to expand their customer base and offer new, differentiated services. Through network slicing, operators can allocate their network resources based on a precise set of performance requirements. Defining a sufficient number of standardized network slice types is essential as customers will expect the same level of service no matter where they are. With the addition of the recommended HMTC slice definition, the resulting standardized slice types should address the most commonly used services and associated performance characteristics. Providing this broader set of standard slice types ensures roaming support, as well as global interoperability for network slicing across network operators. In sum, it is part of what it will take to help 5G reach its potential.</p>\n<p>The post <a href=""https://www.atis.org/iot-categorization-exploring-the-need-for-standardizing-additional-network-slices/"" rel=""nofollow"">IOT Categorization: Exploring the Need for Standardizing Additional Network Slices</a> appeared first on <a href=""https://www.atis.org"" rel=""nofollow"">ATIS</a>.</p>'}","Fri, 03 Jan 2020 01:00:36 +0000",https://www.atis.org/iot-categorization-exploring-the-need-for-standardizing-additional-network-slices/?utm_source=rss&utm_medium=rss&utm_campaign=iot-categorization-exploring-the-need-for-standardizing-additional-network-slices,telecom

Why is one especially critical — particularly as it applies to semi- and fully autonomous vehicles?</em></strong></p>\n\n\n\n<p>Collaborative Cybersecurity is an essential, disruptive, and logical model to enable the introduction of autonomous vehicles on our roads in the safest manner possible.\xa0All industries, and not just the vehicle original equipment manufacturers (OEMs), need to turn the current cybersecurity model on its head.\xa0Governments and commercial organizations alike need to rethink how cybersecurity should work for them to better position themselves against the growing number of threats.\xa0Cybersecurity companies who develop solutions need to reconsider how to increase the value of their product offer by re-imagining their delivery model via cooperation and collaboration both horizontally and vertically. It can no longer be about delivering standalone solutions from individual companies leaving the customers to integrate all these. Here’s why:</p>\n\n\n\n<h2><strong>The “Current” Cybersecurity Model</strong></h2>\n\n\n\n<div class=""wp-block-columns has-2-columns"">\n<div class=""wp-block-column"">\n<p>The current cybersecurity model for vehicle OEMs, and pretty much any other large organization attempting to protect its products and services and internal systems, follows the typical methodology of:</p>\n\n\n\n<ol>\n<li>Research available cybersecurity technologies in the market from various companies as they pertain to their industry/company’s products and services, and internal systems</li>\n<li>Determine which technologies can address which specific cybersecurity problems</li>\n<li>Do some assessments of targeted technologies which seem most promising</li>\n<li>Acquire some of the targeted technologies to integrate within their internal IT processes and for protecting their products and services</li>\n<li>Maximize the use of each technology based on its features and functionality</li>\n<li>Attempt to stitch together these various disparate cybersecurity technologies to create a more unified holistic view and interpretation of the data to discover and act on threats</li>\n<li>Deal with the myriad of updates/upgrades and product overhauls for each cybersecurity technology acquired. Attempt once again to retain a cohesive, integrated security solution, and in parallel attempt to maintain some of the automated processes you had achieved with the earlier versions of these cybersecurity products</li>\n<li>Deal with replacing a product outright when the licensing scheme simply gets too expensive or when the product becomes much less effective compared to others</li>\n<li>Train, train, and retrain your cybersecurity staff to stay on top of all the above</li>\n<li>Retain the services of cybersecurity consultants to assist internal staff in dealing with the onslaught of dealing with all of the above</li>\n</ol>\n\n\n\n<p>&nbsp;</p>\n</div>\n\n\n\n<div class=""wp-block-column"">\n<h4>Securing the Modern Vehicle</h4>\n\n\n\n<p>Findings from a 2018 study by the Ponemon Institute “<a href=""https://www.sae.org/binaries/content/assets/cm/content/topics/cybersecurity/securing_the_modern_vehicle.pdf"" rel=""noreferrer noopener"" target=""_blank"">Securing the Modern Vehicle</a>” shows the precarious position that both vehicle OEMs and their suppliers find themselves.</p>\n\n\n\n<ul>\n<li>84% of respondents in this study have concerns that cybersecurity practices are not keeping pace with evolving technologies</li>\n<li>30% of vehicle OEMs and suppliers combined do not have an established product cybersecurity program or team</li>\n<li>41% of automotive suppliers alone do not have an established product cybersecurity program or team</li>\n<li>63% of respondents test less than half of hardware, software, and other technologies for vulnerabilities</li>\n<li>52% of respondents in the study are aware of potential harm to drivers of vehicles because of insecure automotive technologies, whether developed by third parties or by their organizations</li>\n</ul>\n\n\n\n<figure class=""wp-block-image""><a href=""https://www.sae.org/binaries/content/assets/cm/content/topics/cybersecurity/securing_the_modern_vehicle.pdf"" rel=""noreferrer noopener"" target=""_blank""><img alt="""" class=""wp-image-1967"" src=""https://sites.atis.org/wp-content/uploads/2019/12/securing_the_modern_vehicle_Page_01-791x1024.jpg"" /></a></figure>\n</div>\n</div>\n\n\n\n<p>The cycle is never-ending with little to show for other than <em>attempting </em>to keep up with rapidly increasing and adaptive threats. This model also makes it impossible for organizations to achieve their cybersecurity goals since in the end, constant requests for added funding, time, and resources cannot be met.\xa0</p>\n\n\n\n<h2><strong>The Collaborative Cybersecurity Model</strong></h2>\n\n\n\n<p>In contrast to the current model, the Collective Cybersecurity Model is all about collaborating with participating cybersecurity companies, vehicle OEMs and their suppliers, sharing and exchanging cybersecurity-related information in a continuous real-time manner.\xa0From a high level, when signing on to this model, no partner keeps any information to itself and or waits to share information.\xa0Once information is shared, the partners work together to address the issue as one company.\xa0This way, vehicle OEMs will interact with, a single entity — not four or five different cybersecurity companies.\xa0It’s that simple.\xa0</p>\n\n\n\n<p>The key concepts are “share and exchange” and “continuous real-time.” Threat related information is always made available to all partners for analysis and action when and/or if necessary.\xa0Not only is the threat info shared, but so is the evolving analysis of the threat as well as any required actions to counter it.</p>\n\n\n\n<p>As part of the three-plus years of research ATIS has conducted on <a href=""https://www.atis.org/01_strat_init/connectedcar/"" rel=""noreferrer noopener"" target=""_blank"">Collaborative Cybersecurity</a>, working with the various cybersecurity companies, it is undeniable that every industry needs to revamp its current cybersecurity model. Industries should move to a model that is collaborative at its very roots. A collaborative model will produce the most effective and timely information and provide the best overall protection against the gambit of cyber threats that continue to evolve and grow.</p>\n\n\n\n<h2><strong>Key Elements </strong></h2>\n\n\n\n<p>The Collaborative Cybersecurity model is defined by five Key Elements which consist of the following:</p>\n\n\n\n<ol>\n<li>Threat Intelligence</li>\n<li>Hardware Security</li>\n<li>Software Security</li>\n<li>Network Security</li>\n<li>Cloud Security</li>\n</ol>\n\n\n\n<p>Outlined below are some examples of the high-level functional requirements that fall under each of the Key Elements.\xa0\xa0The functions listed below are by no means exhaustive but serve as a guide as to what one would expect to see under each pillar.\xa0\xa0</p>\n\n\n\n<figure class=""wp-block-image""><img alt="""" class=""wp-image-1959"" src=""https://sites.atis.org/wp-content/uploads/2019/12/collaborative-cybersecurity-model-1024x599.jpg"" /></figure>\n\n\n\n<h2><strong>Conclusions</strong></h2>\n\n\n\n<p>Whenever there is talk of disruptive technology, methods, and processes challenging the Status Quo, there is always a good dose of skepticism.\xa0Some will knock the idea down because it doesn’t fit within their plans. Some will want to protect their interests by retaining the current way of doing business. Even if it is proven to be a failed model to address new cybersecurity problems that keep growing, adapting, and getting smarter faster.\xa0</p>\n\n\n\n<p>Cybersecurity and technology companies need to bring their diverse expertise, experience, and knowledge to the table to showcase the value of a Collaborative Cybersecurity Model for the vehicle OEM industry. If vehicle OEMs cannot demonstrate and develop a coordinated and collaborative cybersecurity strategy to safeguard consumers, governments will likely step in quite vigorously.\xa0Governments may enact specific mandated cybersecurity policies/laws that vehicle OEMs may find expensive and time-consuming to develop, introduce, and support.</p>\n\n\n\n<p>Learn more about the <a href=""https://www.atis.org/01_strat_init/connectedcar/"" rel=""noreferrer noopener"" target=""_blank"">ATIS Connected Vehicle Cybersecurity initiative</a>.</p>\n\n\n\n<p>Read the full post from which this blog is excerpted <a href=""https://www.linkedin.com/pulse/collaborative-cybersecurity-connected-vehicles-denis-niles/"" rel=""noreferrer noopener"" target=""_blank"">here</a>.\xa0 \xa0</p>\n<p>The post <a href=""https://www.atis.org/collaborative-cybersecurity-for-connected-vehicles/"" rel=""nofollow"">Collaborative Cybersecurity for Connected Vehicles</a> appeared first on <a href=""https://www.atis.org"" rel=""nofollow"">ATIS</a>.</p>'}","Tue, 03 Dec 2019 20:35:12 +0000",https://www.atis.org/collaborative-cybersecurity-for-connected-vehicles/?utm_source=rss&utm_medium=rss&utm_campaign=collaborative-cybersecurity-for-connected-vehicles,telecom

Groupe QuèbecTel, a telecommunications company that had previously been owned by BCTel, sold its interests to Telus in 2000 after the merging. Telus’s stake in Quebec is now known as Telus Quèbec.</p>\n<blockquote><p>Public Mobile and Koodo Mobile are a part of the Telus network.</p></blockquote>\n<p>Telus currently owns two subsidiaries: Koodo Mobile and Public Mobile, each of which are considered among the best mobile providers in Canada in the regions where they are offered.

The company amassed CA$38.3 billion in revenue in 2019 (see <a href=""https://www.statista.com/statistics/564838/operating-revenue-of-suncor-energy/"" rel=""noreferrer noopener"" target=""_blank"">Statista</a>), and it has continued expanding across multiple verticals.</p>\n\n\n\n<figure class=""wp-block-embed is-type-video is-provider-youtube wp-block-embed-youtube wp-embed-aspect-16-9 wp-has-aspect-ratio""><div class=""wp-block-embed__wrapper"">\n\n</div></figure>\n\n\n\n<p>Suncor uses a retail market provided by Shell and ExxonMobil to market its products, which puts it far from the now stronger global push for renewables.</p>\n\n\n\n<h2>#7 Canadian National Railway</h2>\n\n\n\n<figure class=""wp-block-image""><img alt=""Canadian National Railway"" class=""wp-image-133"" height=""449"" src=""https://www.ctca.ca/wp-content/uploads/2019/04/Canadian-National-Railway.jpg"" width=""800"" /></figure>\n\n\n\n<p>It is surprising that the <a href=""https://www.cn.ca/"" rel=""noreferrer noopener"" target=""_blank"">Canadian National Railway</a> can be one of the most profitable companies in the country, but Canadians knew how to take care of their infrastructure. Unlike most national railway companies, the country has made sure that its trains bring home the bacon in employment opportunities and profits for shareholders who are ever more eager to modernize the railways. This, of course, helps regular Canadians enjoy even greater benefits both in terms of business and their private lives.</p>\n\n\n\n<p>Exports and domestic routes have been perfected. New technologies have been introduced all in pursuit of boosting the economy. As of 2019, the company had <a href=""https://www.cn.ca/en/investors/financial-results/"" rel=""noreferrer noopener"" target=""_blank"">CA$10,163 billion in revenue</a> (Nine months ended September 30) – a substantial financial performance.</p>\n\n\n\n<h2>#8 BCE Inc.</h2>\n\n\n\n<figure class=""wp-block-image""><img alt=""BCE Inc."" class=""wp-image-134"" height=""435"" src=""https://www.ctca.ca/wp-content/uploads/2019/04/BCE-Inc.png"" width=""800"" /></figure>\n\n\n\n<p>It makes sense that after finances and energy companies, telecoms will be equally popular. <a href=""https://www.bce.ca/"" rel=""noreferrer noopener"" target=""_blank"">BCE Inc.</a> is a publicly-traded telecommunications company with a wide remit of activities. Founded only in 1983, BCE Inc. has grown to dominate the market completely.

The subsidiaries hold around 10 TV stations, which remain some of the country&#8217;s most-watched ones.</p>\n\n\n\n<p>In terms of corporation revenue and capitalization, BCE Inc. remains one of the biggest Canadian companies.</p>\n\n\n\n<h2>#9 Husky Energy</h2>\n\n\n\n<figure class=""wp-block-image""><img alt=""Husky Energy "" class=""wp-image-135"" height=""450"" src=""https://www.ctca.ca/wp-content/uploads/2019/04/Husky-Energy.jpg"" width=""800"" /></figure>\n\n\n\n<p><a href=""https://huskyenergy.com/"" rel=""noreferrer noopener"" target=""_blank"">Husky Energy</a> is easily one of the biggest Canadian companies, but its activities expand well beyond the country&#8217;s borders. The company operates in the United States, the Asia Pacific Region and their company is owned by Hong Kong billionaire Li Ka-Shing. In Q2 in 2020, Husky Energy <a href=""https://huskyenergy.com/news/release.asp?release_id=2070210"" rel=""noreferrer noopener"" target=""_blank"">reported CA$18 millions of revenue</a>. </p>\n\n\n\n<p>The company continues to conduct the bulk of its activities in the country, with the overseas projects increasing at a significant pace.

The push for renewables is still under the radar.</p>\n\n\n\n<h2>#10 The Woodbridge Company Limited</h2>\n\n\n\n<p>You must have certainly heard of <a href=""https://www.woodbridgegroup.com/"" rel=""noreferrer noopener"" target=""_blank"">The Woodbridge Company Limited</a>.

It is important to note that currently, Canadians are lagging behind the world in gaining access to the most recent technological tools.<span id=""more-103""></span>Despite spending a lot of money on telecommunications, Canada has not achieved the heights of broadcasting technology. In this regard, broadcasters are required to follow the mandates that are imposed by the government in order to compete in the foreign market.</p>\n<p>Recently, the CD Howe Institute conducted a comprehensive research study to examine the issues that are related to the broadcasting sector in Canada. The primary objective of the research study was to investigate the flaws in policy making, alterations in technological tools, and adjustments in the competitive landscape. The report of C.D. Howe Institute presented before the administrative authorities of Canada concluded that legislators are not addressing issues that range from wholesale access to net neutrality provisions. Likewise, this deteriorates the influence of novel distribution channels to promote content with potential audiences in Canada.</p>\n<p><img alt=""Canadian telecommunications"" class=""alignleft wp-image-109 size-medium"" height=""200"" src=""https://www.ctca.ca/wp-content/uploads/2018/09/broadcasting-technology-300x200.jpg"" width=""300"" />A recent conference organized by the CD Howe Institute has necessitated the investigation of the technological framework to identify critical tensions in communication infrastructure and content provision. This is important for the communication and broadcasting industry in Canada. To circumvent the issues in the future, it is important to encourage production companies to create and produce content that engages the Canadian audience. The supervisory framework divided between telecommunications and broadcasting requires substantial revisions for the existing technological context. In this way, the consumers would be able to access the content via multiple platforms.</p>\n<p>Currently, the government of Canada is working to promote cloud-based offerings because they are the future of telecommunication. The market size of cloud computing will grow by billions of dollars in the coming years. Canadians will have access to low-power chips easily. Companies will use super-fast inter-connectors in their data centers, and cloud data centers will look like living organisms. Canadian broadcasting industry and research facilities are working on TD-LTE subscriptions that will reach about one billion in a few years, which means that the upcoming cellphones will utilize about 3.5-GHz-TDD spectrum bands. According to the CD Howe Institute, this will improve the performance of phones in terms of network capabilities, which will allow operatives to use novel technologies such as LTE-Hi.</p>\n<p>The CD Howe Institute also put forward that they in collaboration with the government, policymakers, and broadcasting industry are making substantial efforts to invest in Cloud Services, Wireless Networks, Telco 2.0 Business Models, Mobile Traffic, and Mobile Machine to Machine (M2M), Enterprise Mobility, and Big Data technology programs. For this, it is mandatory that the Canadian authorities keenly consider a market-based approach to regulate the content and make it more user-oriented.</p>\n<p>The post <a href=""https://www.ctca.ca/the-future-of-canadian-telecommunications/"" rel=""nofollow"">The Future of Canadian Telecommunications</a> appeared first on <a href=""https://www.ctca.ca"" rel=""nofollow"">Canada TeleCommunications</a>.</p>'}","Sun, 09 Sep 2018 21:00:44 +0000",https://www.ctca.ca/the-future-of-canadian-telecommunications/,telecom

It is not necessary that if one Canadian region is facing certain issue then the same one if being faced by the other region as well. These events are organized just to make sure that the best outcome is provided to the users that are ultimately affected by the performance of the companies.</p>\n<h2>1.

There have been controversies surrounding the bank&#8217;s targets in 2017, but that was largely put behind the institution, although at a price.</p>\n\n\n\n<p>In 2017, employees came forward admitting to cooking the books to make it look like the bank has achieved better sales over the period. This was occasioned by mismanagement and pursuit of bigger profits and juicier stakes for investors. However, the discrepancies in reported figures and net worth was quickly caught, and the issue was addressed swiftly.</p>\n\n\n\n<p>Toronto-Dominion Bank facts: </p>\n\n\n\n<ul><li>In 2020 it counted 90,000 employees all around the world.</li><li>Total assets of Toronto-Dominion Bank were CA$1.7 trillion.

They have managed to accumulate <a href=""https://www.macrotrends.net/stocks/charts/BMO/bank-of-montreal/revenue"" rel=""noreferrer noopener"" target=""_blank"">the massive CA$25.68 billion</a>. Not a bad financial performance altogether. The Bank of Montreal has been inching upwards in the overall list of the biggest Canadian companies.</p>\n\n\n\n<figure class=""wp-block-embed is-type-video is-provider-youtube wp-block-embed-youtube wp-embed-aspect-16-9 wp-has-aspect-ratio""><div class=""wp-block-embed__wrapper"">\n\n</div></figure>\n\n\n\n<p>Montreal&#8217;s premier bank remains dwarfed by Nova Scotia and the Royal Bank, but it is still a preferred choice for many Canadians. The bank has also registered a significant uptick in its operations in the United States, where growth has been significant. BMO Chief Darryl White has also been one of the most reliable housing market analysts, calming the qualms investors and buyers have these days.</p>\n\n\n\n<h2>#5 Online Casino Companies</h2>\n\n\n\n<figure class=""wp-block-image""><img alt=""Online Casino Companies"" class=""wp-image-137"" height=""384"" src=""https://www.ctca.ca/wp-content/uploads/2019/04/Online-Casino-Companies-1.jpg"" width=""800"" /></figure>\n\n\n\n<p>As gambling has taken off in some Canadian provinces, the industry is expected to spread even further across the country.

There have been more tentative efforts to introduce casinos and gambling companies at a larger scale in Canada in the past few years.</p>\n\n\n\n<h2>#6 Suncor Energy</h2>\n\n\n\n<p><a href=""https://www.suncor.com/"" rel=""noreferrer noopener"" target=""_blank"">Suncor Energy</a> was founded as early as 1919, but the company&#8217;s name has been aptly picked to reflect the current shift towards sustainable energy sources. The company focuses on synthetic crude from oil sands. The company amassed CA$38.3 billion in revenue in 2019 (see <a href=""https://www.statista.com/statistics/564838/operating-revenue-of-suncor-energy/"" rel=""noreferrer noopener"" target=""_blank"">Statista</a>), and it has continued expanding across multiple verticals.</p>\n\n\n\n<figure class=""wp-block-embed is-type-video is-provider-youtube wp-block-embed-youtube wp-embed-aspect-16-9 wp-has-aspect-ratio""><div class=""wp-block-embed__wrapper"">\n\n</div></figure>\n\n\n\n<p>Suncor uses a retail market provided by Shell and ExxonMobil to market its products, which puts it far from the now stronger global push for renewables.</p>\n\n\n\n<h2>#7 Canadian National Railway</h2>\n\n\n\n<figure class=""wp-block-image""><img alt=""Canadian National Railway"" class=""wp-image-133"" height=""449"" src=""https://www.ctca.ca/wp-content/uploads/2019/04/Canadian-National-Railway.jpg"" width=""800"" /></figure>\n\n\n\n<p>It is surprising that the <a href=""https://www.cn.ca/"" rel=""noreferrer noopener"" target=""_blank"">Canadian National Railway</a> can be one of the most profitable companies in the country, but Canadians knew how to take care of their infrastructure. Unlike most national railway companies, the country has made sure that its trains bring home the bacon in employment opportunities and profits for shareholders who are ever more eager to modernize the railways. This, of course, helps regular Canadians enjoy even greater benefits both in terms of business and their private lives.</p>\n\n\n\n<p>Exports and domestic routes have been perfected. New technologies have been introduced all in pursuit of boosting the economy. As of 2019, the company had <a href=""https://www.cn.ca/en/investors/financial-results/"" rel=""noreferrer noopener"" target=""_blank"">CA$10,163 billion in revenue</a> (Nine months ended September 30) – a substantial financial performance.</p>\n\n\n\n<h2>#8 BCE Inc.</h2>\n\n\n\n<figure class=""wp-block-image""><img alt=""BCE Inc."" class=""wp-image-134"" height=""435"" src=""https://www.ctca.ca/wp-content/uploads/2019/04/BCE-Inc.png"" width=""800"" /></figure>\n\n\n\n<p>It makes sense that after finances and energy companies, telecoms will be equally popular. <a href=""https://www.bce.ca/"" rel=""noreferrer noopener"" target=""_blank"">BCE Inc.</a> is a publicly-traded telecommunications company with a wide remit of activities.

The subsidiaries hold around 10 TV stations, which remain some of the country&#8217;s most-watched ones.</p>\n\n\n\n<p>In terms of corporation revenue and capitalization, BCE Inc. remains one of the biggest Canadian companies.</p>\n\n\n\n<h2>#9 Husky Energy</h2>\n\n\n\n<figure class=""wp-block-image""><img alt=""Husky Energy "" class=""wp-image-135"" height=""450"" src=""https://www.ctca.ca/wp-content/uploads/2019/04/Husky-Energy.jpg"" width=""800"" /></figure>\n\n\n\n<p><a href=""https://huskyenergy.com/"" rel=""noreferrer noopener"" target=""_blank"">Husky Energy</a> is easily one of the biggest Canadian companies, but its activities expand well beyond the country&#8217;s borders. The company operates in the United States, the Asia Pacific Region and their company is owned by Hong Kong billionaire Li Ka-Shing. In Q2 in 2020, Husky Energy <a href=""https://huskyenergy.com/news/release.asp?release_id=2070210"" rel=""noreferrer noopener"" target=""_blank"">reported CA$18 millions of revenue</a>. </p>\n\n\n\n<p>The company continues to conduct the bulk of its activities in the country, with the overseas projects increasing at a significant pace.

The primary objective of the research study was to investigate the flaws in policy making, alterations in technological tools, and adjustments in the competitive landscape. The report of C.D. Howe Institute presented before the administrative authorities of Canada concluded that legislators are not addressing issues that range from wholesale access to net neutrality provisions. Likewise, this deteriorates the influence of novel distribution channels to promote content with potential audiences in Canada.</p>\n<p><img alt=""Canadian telecommunications"" class=""alignleft wp-image-109 size-medium"" height=""200"" src=""https://www.ctca.ca/wp-content/uploads/2018/09/broadcasting-technology-300x200.jpg"" width=""300"" />A recent conference organized by the CD Howe Institute has necessitated the investigation of the technological framework to identify critical tensions in communication infrastructure and content provision. This is important for the communication and broadcasting industry in Canada. To circumvent the issues in the future, it is important to encourage production companies to create and produce content that engages the Canadian audience. The supervisory framework divided between telecommunications and broadcasting requires substantial revisions for the existing technological context. In this way, the consumers would be able to access the content via multiple platforms.</p>\n<p>Currently, the government of Canada is working to promote cloud-based offerings because they are the future of telecommunication. The market size of cloud computing will grow by billions of dollars in the coming years. Canadians will have access to low-power chips easily. Companies will use super-fast inter-connectors in their data centers, and cloud data centers will look like living organisms. Canadian broadcasting industry and research facilities are working on TD-LTE subscriptions that will reach about one billion in a few years, which means that the upcoming cellphones will utilize about 3.5-GHz-TDD spectrum bands. According to the CD Howe Institute, this will improve the performance of phones in terms of network capabilities, which will allow operatives to use novel technologies such as LTE-Hi.</p>\n<p>The CD Howe Institute also put forward that they in collaboration with the government, policymakers, and broadcasting industry are making substantial efforts to invest in Cloud Services, Wireless Networks, Telco 2.0 Business Models, Mobile Traffic, and Mobile Machine to Machine (M2M), Enterprise Mobility, and Big Data technology programs. For this, it is mandatory that the Canadian authorities keenly consider a market-based approach to regulate the content and make it more user-oriented.</p>\n<p>The post <a href=""https://www.ctca.ca/the-future-of-canadian-telecommunications/"" rel=""nofollow"">The Future of Canadian Telecommunications</a> appeared first on <a href=""https://www.ctca.ca"" rel=""nofollow"">Canada TeleCommunications</a>.</p>'}","Sun, 09 Sep 2018 21:00:44 +0000",https://www.ctca.ca/the-future-of-canadian-telecommunications/,telecom

The best part of all such events is that it brings together the people from different telecom companies that are considered as market rivals. It also means that the companies of the Canadian telecom sector are ready to help out each other just to make sure that the telecom sector sees the boom it deserves at the national level.<span id=""more-26""></span>The other important thing that is worth considering is the fact that these events don’t have particular agenda to follow and vary from place to place. It is not necessary that if one Canadian region is facing certain issue then the same one if being faced by the other region as well. These events are organized just to make sure that the best outcome is provided to the users that are ultimately affected by the performance of the companies.</p>\n<h2>1. Canadian Telecom Summit</h2>\n<p>This event can be referred to as the summit of the top brass of telecom sector. The best part of Canadian Telecom Summit is that it allows the company representatives to carry out the plans and strategies jointly so that they get the deserved output. The summit also allows such representatives to share their opinions and views just to make sure that the best and the most advanced outcome are generated for the industry as a whole. The summit takes place at different Canadian provinces each year. The summit also allows the participants to present thought-provoking ideas so that these can be applied to the future of the Canadian telecom sector.</p>\n<h2>2. Canadian ISP Summit</h2>\n<p><img alt=""Canadian ISP Summit"" class=""alignright wp-image-29 size-medium"" height=""132"" src=""https://www.ctca.ca/wp-content/uploads/2018/02/Canadian-ISP-summit-300x132.jpg"" width=""300"" />This summit ensures that the best talent of the telecom sector is brought forward. It will also ensure that the best policies are devised for the large companies which can be applied to get the maximum out of the human capital in question. Canadian ISP Summit is all about presenting the talent to the world. It is a great place for the telecom companies to conduct business. The summit is the best place to get the different sectors of the telecom field closer for maximum interaction.</p>\n<h2>3. Canadian Wireless Trade Show</h2>\n<p>For the past 7 years, Toronto has been hosting this show which means that the professionals from all telecom related departments gather to devise future plans. The companies that are associated with the show are the ones that have maximum reach and therefore the trade show is highly praised. It also allows the companies to present the in-house developments which can be sold to other companies to earn revenue.</p>\n<h2>4. 2018 CITA Telecommunications</h2>\n<p>It is a series of events which are held all over Canada and has different themes. From cyber and telecom security to protection from hacking this summit is attended by hundreds from all over Canada. The entry fee is to be paid by both CITA and Non-CITA members. The word CITA stands for Canadian Independent Telecommunications Association. The CITA member needs to pay $295 as entry fee and non-CITA member needs to pay $500 for an entry fee.</p>\n<h2>Final Thoughts</h2>\n<p>The <a href=""https://www.ctca.ca/10-of-the-biggest-canadian-companies/"">biggest Canadian companies</a> in the telecom sector, including BCE Inc., continue to gather at these summits and trade show despite the fact, that they are competitors. It proves that competition is healthy. Competition encourages sharing ideas and information about new technologies, which will propel the industry to new levels of success. All parties involved benefit from it.</p>\n<p>What do you think? Have you ever been to one of these events? We highly recommend visiting one of them in the future if you are already working or looking to build a career in the telecom industry. It is possible to do a bit of networking as well as see what the leading companies are doing at the moment and what they are planning for the near future.</p>\n<p>The post <a href=""https://www.ctca.ca/canadian-telecom-events-you-should-visit/"" rel=""nofollow"">Canadian Telecom Events You Should Visit</a> appeared first on <a href=""https://www.ctca.ca"" rel=""nofollow"">Canada TeleCommunications</a>.</p>'}","Fri, 09 Feb 2018 10:04:15 +0000",https://www.ctca.ca/canadian-telecom-events-you-should-visit/,telecom

But if you want your reception catering to be everything that you have dreamed of, you have to ask and determine some key details. Though caterers of wedding receptions can function around virtually any circumstances or condition, you can make it simpler for everybody once you guarantee that your venue will give some critical features.

If this is the case, they may prohibit you to hire an independent caterer to serve on your wedding day. In other instances, they will allow you to do so but you are expected to pay the additional fee to do this. This is a crucial factor to consider, particularly when you already selected a catering company.  </p>\n<p>Does the reception venue permit for catering materials disposal? </p>\n<p>Not all venues will permit you to use their cans or dumpsters after cleanup. When your caterer should pack out the waste, this can impact their logistics and possibly the food price.  </p>\n<p>Does the venue have water that can be used for catering purposes? </p>\n<p>Without a doubt, your chosen reception catering provider will require water to be used for different purposes, but particularly for hand washing. When cold and hot running water is unavailable at the venue you are considering, then your caterer must bring the right temperature-regulated storage vessels to meet health code requirements and ensure safety. </p>\n<p>Can your caterer use the power in the reception? </p>\n<p>Similar to water, your reception caterer will need the power to make sure that your food will be kept at the appropriate temperature until it’s time to serve your wedding attendees. When you opt for a venue without a power supply nearby, you should ask your caterer whether they can bring and use other power sources like generators.  </p>\n<p>Will your caterer have a place to stage and set up? </p>\n<p>Even if this is not a deal-breaker, a lot of catering companies require an appropriate area to set up and stage everything. The size of the space will differ based on the number of your expected attendees and your menu. But when they have to serve cold or hot food without a staging area, the catering company may need to carry a refrigerated truck or even warming ovens.  </p>\n<p>Do you have tables for catering purposes? </p>\n<p>Other wedding reception venues let you use the chairs, tables, etc. that they have. Some let the tenant use them considering that they pay an additional fee. However, a lot of venues don’t have such amenities ready to be used. If this is the case, you may have to rent your equipment or ask your selected catering company how they usually resolve this issue. </p>\n<p>The post <a href=""http://www.isistelecom.com/must-ask-catering-questions-when-selecting-a-wedding-reception-venue/"" rel=""nofollow"">Must-Ask Catering Questions When Selecting a Wedding Reception Venue</a> appeared first on <a href=""http://www.isistelecom.com"" rel=""nofollow"">Isis Telecom</a>.</p>'}","Fri, 29 Jan 2021 15:01:01 +0000",http://www.isistelecom.com/must-ask-catering-questions-when-selecting-a-wedding-reception-venue/,telecom

But if you want your reception catering to be everything that you have dreamed of, you have to ask and determine some key details. Though caterers of wedding receptions can function around virtually any circumstances or condition, you can make it simpler for everybody once you guarantee that your venue will give some critical features.

If this is the case, they may prohibit you to hire an independent caterer to serve on your wedding day. In other instances, they will allow you to do so but you are expected to pay the additional fee to do this. This is a crucial factor to consider, particularly when you already selected a catering company.  </p>\n<p>Does the reception venue permit for catering materials disposal? </p>\n<p>Not all venues will permit you to use their cans or dumpsters after cleanup. When your caterer should pack out the waste, this can impact their logistics and possibly the food price.  </p>\n<p>Does the venue have water that can be used for catering purposes? </p>\n<p>Without a doubt, your chosen reception catering provider will require water to be used for different purposes, but particularly for hand washing. When cold and hot running water is unavailable at the venue you are considering, then your caterer must bring the right temperature-regulated storage vessels to meet health code requirements and ensure safety. </p>\n<p>Can your caterer use the power in the reception? </p>\n<p>Similar to water, your reception caterer will need the power to make sure that your food will be kept at the appropriate temperature until it’s time to serve your wedding attendees. When you opt for a venue without a power supply nearby, you should ask your caterer whether they can bring and use other power sources like generators.  </p>\n<p>Will your caterer have a place to stage and set up? </p>\n<p>Even if this is not a deal-breaker, a lot of catering companies require an appropriate area to set up and stage everything. The size of the space will differ based on the number of your expected attendees and your menu. But when they have to serve cold or hot food without a staging area, the catering company may need to carry a refrigerated truck or even warming ovens.  </p>\n<p>Do you have tables for catering purposes? </p>\n<p>Other wedding reception venues let you use the chairs, tables, etc. that they have. Some let the tenant use them considering that they pay an additional fee. However, a lot of venues don’t have such amenities ready to be used. If this is the case, you may have to rent your equipment or ask your selected catering company how they usually resolve this issue. </p>\n<p>The post <a href=""http://www.isistelecom.com/must-ask-catering-questions-when-selecting-a-wedding-reception-venue/"" rel=""nofollow"">Must-Ask Catering Questions When Selecting a Wedding Reception Venue</a> appeared first on <a href=""http://www.isistelecom.com"" rel=""nofollow"">Isis Telecom</a>.</p>'}","Fri, 29 Jan 2021 15:01:01 +0000",http://www.isistelecom.com/must-ask-catering-questions-when-selecting-a-wedding-reception-venue/,telecom

But when your flashing is damaged, it cannot do this job properly.  </p>\n<p>If your older flashing is made out of tar or asphalt, then you have to think about getting your roof replaced to set up a metal flashing system that’ll perfectly keep leaks out. </p>\n<p>Development of mildew and mold </p>\n<p>The most typical substances that grow on roofs include algae, moss, mildew, and mold. Their development is mostly due to leaks and water damage. They are commonly pretty simple to determine so they can serve as a great sign to watch for to know your roof’s condition. Still, it’s best to make sure to determine whether the problem is an outcome of the plumbing before you consider going for a roof replacement.  </p>\n<p>Moisture or leaks </p>\n<p>When you have a leaking roof, it’ll be pretty obvious that there’s something wrong. It could be a huge issue, specifically when it’s made out of wooden beams, and can result in mold and rot development.  </p>\n<p>To be updated with this, a regular roof inspection is a must, especially after a heavy downpour. This way you can notice whether there are any water trails from dark spots or leaks that could mean that moisture has reached under your roofing.  </p>\n<p>Sagging </p>\n<p>Sagging is one of the telltale signs that you should pay attention to. Usually, this is a structural damage symptom that can include structural failure, poor spacing, or inadequate bracing. When this is your case, then don’t hesitate to reach out to a trusted roofing expert right away.  </p>\n<p>These are only a few of the many reasons why getting a new roof is a must instead of paying for several costly roof repairs fixing issues that keep on occurring. If you plan to use, roof restoration or replacement services, don’t hesitate to contact the expert roofers. </p>\n<p>The post <a href=""http://www.isistelecom.com/when-should-you-get-a-new-roof/"" rel=""nofollow"">When Should You Get a New Roof?</a> appeared first on <a href=""http://www.isistelecom.com"" rel=""nofollow"">Isis Telecom</a>.</p>'}","Mon, 25 Jan 2021 14:54:37 +0000",http://www.isistelecom.com/when-should-you-get-a-new-roof/,telecom

To help boost your septic system’s overall efficiency then it’s best to consider pumping your septic tank.\u202f </p>\n<p>To eliminate any problematic objects </p>\n<p>Perhaps you might have heard by now that there are particular things that you must never flush down your toilet. Though these things are not clogging your pipes as of now, they fill up your tank easily and probably need to have your septic pumped more often. If you flush the forbidden items, make sure to have your tank pumped right away and don’t wait for a long time. Once you start with an empty tank, it can provide you peace of mind since you know that you can prevent doing such mistakes again.\u202f </p>\n<p>To avoid other issues or backup </p>\n<p>Preventative maintenance will help you prevent all types of issues such as strange odors, slow draining, leaking pipes, and backup. Other advantages of preventative maintenance are can help you save money since it prevents unwanted repairs and unlucky warning indications of a malfunctioning septic system. These are not just disgusting and a hassle to clean up after, they can also result in more damage to your home or the septic system. </p>\n<p>Your tank has accumulated too many solids </p>\n<p>This reason is probably the most obvious why it’s a must to do septic pumping. Once you decide to wait for too long, a tank packed with too much solid build-up can result in problems that would cost way higher than a simple\u202f<a href=""https://www.septictankcleaningsydney.com.au/"">septic tank pump out</a>\u202fservice. When you decide to plan based on your pumping schedule, you won’t experience an overflow of solids into your leach field. Tanks with excessive solid accumulation cause slower draining and cause backups. If you believe that your tank is already close to getting full or it has filled its space, it would be best if you contact a septic pump service provider just to be safe.\u202f </p>\n<p>It’s time for septic pumping </p>\n<p>There are several factors that can affect when you should have your septic tank pumped out once a year or every few years. These factors include the number of people at your house, the size of your tank, what you usually flush down your toilet, how frequently your family members are adding to the system, and when you utilize a garbage disposal. Your septic tank must be pumped to minimize the accumulation and reduce the risk of it backing up into your property. Moreover, it allows you to clean and check the filter if you have one. Even if you’re unsure whether it’s time for septic pumping, it would be best to do the safe approach when it has been a while.\u202f </p>\n<p>The post <a href=""http://www.isistelecom.com/importance-of-septic-pumping/"" rel=""nofollow"">Importance of Septic Pumping</a> appeared first on <a href=""http://www.isistelecom.com"" rel=""nofollow"">Isis Telecom</a>.</p>'}","Fri, 22 Jan 2021 14:43:22 +0000",http://www.isistelecom.com/importance-of-septic-pumping/,telecom

The founders believed that by joining forces, Norway could get a leg up in the AI race, igniting a more digital and more competitive Norwegian economy and, perhaps, even society-at-large. Like we said, big and bold.</p>\n<p>So, has the Norwegian Open AI Lab (NAIL) lived up to the expectations so far? It certainly did, and here are 10 reasons why.</p>\n<ol>\n<li><strong>If we build it, they will come. </strong>By year-end 2020, NAIL boasted 12 partners and a core team of 12 professors, more than 20 associate researchers and more than 75 PhD student in AI. Partners DNB, Equinor, Kongsberg Group and DNV joined in 2018, bringing more data, more real-life problems, and more funding from across Norwegian industries.</li>\n<li><strong>It started a trend</strong>. <a href=""https://www.telenor.com/media/press-release/a-strengthened-national-powerhouse-for-artificial-intelligence-in-norway"" rel=""noopener noreferrer"" target=""_blank"">Once the AI Lab was announced</a>, it sparked a chain reaction across Norway and more research and innovation communities popped up, such as CAIR (Center of Artificial Intelligence at University of Agder) and NORA (Norwegian Artificial Intelligence Research Consortium). Two AI student organizations were also founded with NAIL support: BRAIN NTNU and Cogito.</li>\n<li><strong>Our friends benefit too</strong>. <a href=""https://www.telenor.com/media/announcement/new-norwegian-ai-centre-ready-to-shape-the-future"" rel=""noopener noreferrer"" target=""_blank"">The Centre for AI –Research-based Innovation SFI NorwAI kicked-off in 2020</a>, with 260 million NOK funding from the Norwegian Research Council and industry partners (including Telenor) in its coffers. Researchers from NAIL are also taking part in this project, which is considered the largest of its kind in Norway.</li>\n<li><strong>NAIL puts Norway on the AI map in Europe</strong>. Since 2019, the two NAIL founders participate in the largest EU-funded AI consortium called <a href=""https://www.ai4eu.eu/"" rel=""noopener noreferrer"" target=""_blank"">AI4EU</a>, with a mandate to build AI momentum across Europe.</li>\n<li><strong>It’s AI-elementary, my dear.</strong> In 2020, <a href=""https://www.telenor.com/telenor-sets-a-good-example-on-ai-upskilling/"" rel=""noopener noreferrer"" target=""_blank"">the AI Lab launched the first and only introductory AI course for the whole Norway</a> and challenged the private and public sector on the speed and volumes of learning.

The team says that nearly every top minister has visited except the Prime one. But perhaps 2021 will be the year?</li>\n<li><strong>It’s ok to ask for directions</strong>. Even Norway did. Throughout 2018-2020, the centre contributed to the Norwegian national AI strategy by providing input, organising seminars, and engaging politicians and policymakers. NAIL pushed for greater investment in AI research and education and stronger collaboration across academia, industry, and government.</li>\n<li><strong>And the best master’s thesis award goes to</strong>… Every year since 2017, NAIL awards prizes to top-notch, cutting-edge AI students who are developing methods of high impact for Norwegian industry and society. Some carefully selected talents make the pitch, and the top three prizes are given with well-deserved accolades each year. What a recognition!</li>\n<li><strong>Speaking of students</strong> – more than 20 Master students can now say they’ve been able to complete their theses with guidance and support from Telenor Research. Topics covered included cyber threat detection, fake news classification, air quality forecasting and other burning issues for the world.</li>\n<li><strong>One thing leads to another</strong>. The Norwegian Open AI Lab brand is strong, also among young talents, and it has opened doors to many interesting research and innovation endeavors in Norway and beyond in its four years of existence.

This is a sport where accuracy isn’t just optimal, it’s essential.</p>\n<p>“Actually, the challenges a chatbot faces are quite similar to the ones that confront a fencer,” he continues.</p>\n<p>“Both need to gain a certain skill set to master unpredictable scenarios to accomplish their tasks successfully. Each person who contacts a chatbot wants the same thing. Not to land a hit, of course, but to get accurate information to solve an issue.

From its first day of operations to the time of writing, the AI robot has handled more than one million customer inquiries.</p>\n<p>“It’s been a fascinating journey so far, and the number of Telmi users has steadily increased since we launched it,” says Lossius, adding that the chatbot processed more than 630,000 customer inquiries in 2020.</p>\n<p>“According to our estimates, this will increase by 10 percent in 2021, as we continue implementing Telmi in other Telenor Norway services. For 2023, our goal is for Telmi to process more than 770,000 customer inquiries.”</p>\n<p>The introduction of Telmi into new services requires a lot of calibrating and updating of the chatbot’s algorithm.</p>\n<p>“We constantly train Telmi to get better at recognising new words, meanings, questions, and to better interact with both our internal systems and with humans. Because, as I said earlier, humans are unpredictable.”</p>\n<p><a class=""bulletBlueChevron"" href=""https://www.telenor.com/lean-green-telco-machine-how-ai-is-greening-mobile-networks/"" rel=""noopener noreferrer"" target=""_blank"">This is how Telenor utilises AI technology in its networks to create a greener future.</a></p>\n<figure class=""wp-caption alignnone"" id=""attachment_61843"" style=""width: 2560px;""><img alt="""" class=""wp-image-61843 size-full"" height=""1707"" src=""https://www.telenor.com/wp-content/uploads/2021/02/Telmi-1-scaled.jpg"" width=""2560"" /><figcaption class=""wp-caption-text"" id=""caption-attachment-61843"">Preferred: Telmi is a text-based chatbot, which, according to Lossius, is the most popular use of speaking computers in the telecom sector today: “Text is much easier to recognise, understand, and interpret compared to speech.”</figcaption></figure>\n<h2>Robot fine-tuning</h2>\n<p>That unpredictability comes with layers of nuance, as we humans do not always say or write what we <em>actually </em>mean.</p>\n<p>“If a customer states ‘I would like to add more 4G to my phone’, it basically makes no sense. Humans, with the right knowledge, understand that the customer is actually referring to data, but it’s harder to teach a text-based machine to correctly interpret improper use of terms.”</p>\n<p>As providers continue to deliver new and ever more complex services to customers, the latter invent and adopt new ways of talking about them, explains Lossius.</p>\n<p>“It’s no wonder chatbots often struggle to find the answers customers are looking for. But with help from the research arm of Telenor, we’ve been able to fine-tune Telmi into serving customers more accurate information than ever before.”</p>\n<p><a class=""bulletBlueChevron"" href=""https://www.telenor.com/innovation/artificial-intelligence/"" rel=""noopener noreferrer"" target=""_blank"">Also read: Telenor&#8217;s goal in AI</a></p>\n<figure class=""wp-caption alignnone"" id=""attachment_61845"" style=""width: 2560px;""><img alt="""" class=""wp-image-61845 size-full"" height=""1707"" src=""https://www.telenor.com/wp-content/uploads/2021/02/AI-Trainer-1-scaled.jpg"" width=""2560"" /><figcaption class=""wp-caption-text"" id=""caption-attachment-61845"">Comprehensive: An increasing number of different customer related problems are directed to Telmi: “It needs to know about everything Telenor does, from PUK codes and invoices to fixed internet and coverage,” explains Olav Alexander Sell, Content Developer and AI Trainer at Telenor Norway.</figcaption></figure>\n<h2>More accurate each day</h2>\n<p>Some of Telmi’s increased accuracy stems from analyses of conversations between Telmi and customers. ‘Intents,’ as the chatbot professionals call it.</p>\n<p>“Every customer has an intention for contacting Telmi. Right now, Telmi can handle about 2,000 different predicted customer intents. For Telmi, an intent is, easily explained, a code. What you and I write in the chatbot log translates into codes, which tell the chatbot’s algorithm what sort of information it needs to provide,” explains Eleonora Freddi, Senior Research Scientist at Telenor Research.</p>\n<p>During spring 2020, the Telmi team gathered data from 150,000 conversations, which they handed to Freddi and her colleagues in Telenor Research. The result from the enormous material analysis has proved itself hugely valuable.</p>\n<p><a class=""bulletBlueChevron"" href=""https://www.telenor.com/how-our-mobility-data-can-help-predict-and-prevent-the-spread-of-covid-19/"">Telenor Research also supports the Norwegian government in combating the Covid-19 pandemic.

Eilertsen, Hilde Østvold, Monica Loftsgård.</figcaption></figure>\n<h2>Increased customer satisfaction</h2>\n<p>“From our analysis, we found that one percent of the intents accounted for 34 percent of all the conversations. This was a very important finding. It told us that improving only 27 of Telmi’s interpretation could potentially improve a third of all interactions between Telmi and customers,” Freddi tells us.</p>\n<p>Based on the results, the AI trainers implemented changes to the chatbot. They have since seen a significant difference in measured customer satisfaction. However, providing more accurate information won’t necessarily boost every customer’s satisfaction.</p>\n<p>“A customer’s satisfaction is mostly dependent on whether the issue was solved or not, which is very understandable. A chatbot can’t fix all problems, for instance, network coverage issues. So, even though the correct information is provided, the customer may be frustrated because the issue isn’t solved. Because of this, the customer may rate the chatbot as non-helpful. In general, it’s a challenging exercise to measure customers’ chatbot satisfaction,” says Freddi, adding that she and her colleagues are currently analysing a new set of data from Telmi conversations.</p>\n<p>Despite the potential for improvement, today’s chatbots have come a long way compared to where it all started, says one of the legends within the AI research field in Norway.</p>\n<p><a class=""bulletBlueChevron"" href=""https://www.telenor.com/telenor-sets-a-good-example-on-ai-upskilling/"" rel=""noopener noreferrer"" target=""_blank"">Interested in Artificial Intelligence?

Still, our vision is that Telmi one day will be able to solve every issue for customers in a satisfying way.”</figcaption></figure>\n<h2>The &#8216;friendly computer&#8217;</h2>\n<p>“In the 90s, we envisioned the friendly computer. A machine that spoke to humans in a ‘human’ way. It was merely a fantasy at that time, but today people are getting used to speaking to computers and virtual assistants,” says Telenor Research’s Knut Kvale, who started working with speech-based services in Telenor back in 1994.</p>\n<p>The senior research scientist points to the chatbot’s ability to fill a growing customer need as the reason for its increasing success.</p>\n<p>“Internal statistics show that about 50 percent of customers have visited our web page before calling our customer service desk. That’s a clear indication that we as customers are trying to find solutions by ourselves. Therefore, it can be beneficial for us to get help along the way from a friendly computer,” he says, stating that we should expect to be acquainted with a rising number of helpful machines in the future.</p>\n<p><a class=""bulletBlueChevron"" href=""https://www.telenor.com/media/announcement/new-norwegian-ai-centre-ready-to-shape-the-future"" rel=""noopener noreferrer"" target=""_blank"">This new Norwegian AI centre is ready to shape the future</a></p>\n<figure class=""wp-caption alignnone"" id=""attachment_61858"" style=""width: 2560px;""><img alt="""" class=""wp-image-61858 size-full"" height=""1707"" src=""https://www.telenor.com/wp-content/uploads/2021/02/Knut-2-scaled.jpg"" width=""2560"" /><figcaption class=""wp-caption-text"" id=""caption-attachment-61858"">Mr. chatbot: Knut Kvale has worked with speech technology since the late 1980s. He holds a degree in civil engineering from the Norwegian University of Science and Technology.</figcaption></figure>\n<h2>A chatbot breakthrough on the horizon?</h2>\n<p>“I believe we are standing on the doorstep of a huge chatbot breakthrough. Because, in addition to chatbots’ ability to serve customers at a fast pace, they provide a form of anonymity. People are rather uncomfortable with discussing certain topics with other humans. Therefore, I expect we’ll see a future increase in the implementation of chatbots in sectors such as health, finance, and local and regional government, to name a few.”</p>\n<p>Kvale hopes that the more we interact with chatbots, the better the quality of each conversation will become.</p>\n<p>“All communication must be adjusted based on who the recipient is. We usually need to communicate differently with a five-year-old than with an adult. The same applies when we’re communicating with machines. In most cases they only need the key information spelled correctly to serve you in the best possible way. What I’m saying is that we humans need to adapt a little to the chatbots as well to get the best experience possible. Because, as we all know, it takes two to tango.”</p>\n<p><a class=""bulletBlueChevron"" href=""https://www.telenor.com/innovation/stories"" rel=""noopener noreferrer"" target=""_blank"">Hungry for more insight?

The safety, security and wellbeing of our employees and those employed by our suppliers remains our primary concern. In recent days, we have sought to adapt our operations to ensure the safety of our employees and the provision of essential services to the Myanmar people – whether food and drink, electricity, telecommunications, financial services or manufacturing &#8211; while respecting the individual rights to freedom of expression of our employees and the people of Myanmar.</p>\n<p>As investors, we inhabit a ‘shared space’ with the people of Myanmar, including civil society organisations, in which we all benefit from respect for human rights, democracy and fundamental freedoms – including freedom of expression and association &#8211; and the rule of law. The rule of law, respect for human rights, and the unrestricted flow of information all contribute to a stable business environment.</p>\n<p>We have always sought to operate in Myanmar transparently, and in line with core ILO Conventions and the UN Guiding Principles on Business and Human Rights. This includes undertaking ongoing human rights and wider business integrity due diligence, and complying with applicable sanctions, as well as the US Foreign Corrupt Practices Act (FCPA), the UK Anti-Bribery Act and Myanmar anti-bribery laws.</p>\n<p>We will also continue to work hand in hand with local business partners which share the same approach. We believe our business presence, practices, and advocacy for a level playing field for all businesses, and our commitment to international human rights standards contribute in a significant way to the journey of openness and democracy in Myanmar.</p>\n<p>We remain committed to our employees and to the people of Myanmar. We hope to see a swift resolution of the current situation based on dialogue and reconciliation in accordance with the will and interests of the people of Myanmar.</p></blockquote>\n<p>Signatories</p>\n<table class=""elx_tbl_list"">\n<tbody>\n<tr class=""elx_tr0"">\n<td class=""elx_td_center"" width=""33%""><strong>Acteus</strong></td>\n<td class=""elx_td_center"" width=""33%""><strong>adidas</strong></td>\n<td class=""elx_td_center"" width=""33%""><strong>Amer Sports</strong></td>\n</tr>\n<tr class=""elx_tr1"">\n<td class=""elx_td_center"" width=""33%""><strong>Artelia</strong></td>\n<td class=""elx_td_center"" width=""33%""><strong>Asian Research Institute for Environmental Law (ARIEL)</strong></td>\n<td class=""elx_td_center"" width=""33%""><strong>Audaxia Global</strong></td>\n</tr>\n<tr class=""elx_tr0"">\n<td class=""elx_td_center"" width=""33%""><strong>Audier &amp;

Telenor Group’s response to proposed Myanmar Cyber Security Bill (Updated 8.3.2021),,"<p>(Fornebu, 8 March 2021) Telenor Group calls for reinstatement of civil liberties and human rights protection and restoration of a sound legal framework in Myanmar with proportionality and proper checks and balances.</p>

In that law, parts of the proposed Cyber Security Bill have been included, namely the chapter on protecting personal data, as well as some provisions in the chapter on offence and penalties. The amendments have passed without due process, and our previous concerns on these chapters remains.</p>\n<p>Furthermore, other amendments have been made to existing laws in Myanmar. Parts of the Law Protecting Privacy and Security of Citizens were suspended, and changes were made to the Penal Code and Criminal Procedural Code, resulting in a weakening of rule of law.</p>\n<p>As a corporate citizen, we are concerned that the amendments collectively broaden the powers awarded to the military authorities and reduce protection of civil liberties and human rights in the country. This is combined with lack of checks and balances from government, civil service and judiciary. None of the changes have undergone proper consultation with civil society, stakeholders or interest groups. Thus, there is good reason to question both the lack of due process as well as proportionality of introduced penalties.</p>\n<p>Telenor Group calls for reinstatement of civil liberties and human rights protection and restoration of a sound legal framework in Myanmar with proportionality and proper checks and balances.</p>\n<h2>Telenor Group’s response to proposed Myanmar Cyber Security Bill</h2>\n<p><strong>15 February 2021:</strong> In response to the authorities’ request for consultation, Telenor Group has raised several issues. Telenor Group is of the strong opinion that the Cyber Security Bill should not be passed as proposed.</p>\n<p>The current, very short and limited, consultation has not allowed for the required dialogue on the proposed Cyber Security Bill. Given the broad scope of the proposed Bill and extensive powers that could significantly impact many, the proposed Bill should be properly consulted with a broad range of affected stakeholders (allowing public debate) and debated in Parliament to ensure that the law is fit for purpose and in line with the Constitution of Myanmar.</p>\n<p>Telenor’s entry into Myanmar in 2013/14 was premised on binding commitments from the Myanmar authorities in relation to key regulations and laws that would update Myanmar’s telecom regulatory framework in line with international best practice, including respecting fundamental rights.\xa0 This includes enacting an independent telecommunications regulator and putting in place a sound Lawful Intercept framework. We refer to our previous dialogue with the Ministry of Transport and Communications and the Post and Telecommunications Department setting forth our comments and suggestions to this effect.\xa0 We are concerned that the proposed Bill does not progress relevant regulatory frameworks and law for a digital future, nor promotes and safeguards digital safety and rights.</p>\n<p>Further, Myanmar has international obligations in relation to international agreements, treaties and international human rights law.\xa0 These obligations include respect for rule of law and good governance, and respect for the protection of human rights and fundamental freedoms.</p>\n<p>To this end, Telenor Group outlines four key principles in relation to the proposed Bill.\xa0 We strongly object to the passing of the proposed Bill without addressing the concerns below:</p>\n<ul>\n<li><strong>Human rights considerations:</strong> The proposed Bill must give due consideration to fundamental human rights such as freedom of speech and expression in Myanmar and personal privacy and security concerns to people in Myanmar.</li>\n<li><strong>Applicability of the proposed Bill:</strong> Passing the proposed Bill during a state of emergency and granting such broad powers to a temporary administration is not appropriate.</li>\n<li><strong>Execution of powers:</strong> There must be transparency, legal certainty, due process and clear criteria for the exercise of powers and interventions, independent administration and independent oversight under the proposed Bill.</li>\n<li><strong>Scope of proposed Bill:</strong> The proposed Bill should not include powers which can be used to order Lawful Interception, which is covered by the Telecom Law. Further, laws governing personal data protection, electronic transactions and cyber security should be kept separate to allow for more comprehensive protection, governance and execution across all areas.</li>\n</ul>\n<p>The post <a href=""https://www.telenor.com/media/press-release/telenor-groups-response-to-proposed-myanmar-cyber-security-bill"" rel=""nofollow"">Telenor Group’s response to proposed Myanmar Cyber Security Bill (Updated 8.3.2021)</a> appeared first on <a href=""https://www.telenor.com"" rel=""nofollow"">Telenor Group</a>.</p>'}","Mon, 15 Feb 2021 18:12:10 +0000",https://www.telenor.com/media/press-release/telenor-groups-response-to-proposed-myanmar-cyber-security-bill,telecom
Directives from authorities in Myanmar – February-March 2021,,"<p>On Monday 1 February, a state of emergency was declared under military leadership in Myanmar. The situation in Myanmar is irregular and uncertain, and the authorities are establishing procedures for issuing directives towards operators. Telenor handles these according to its defined processes for authority directives. At Telenor we remain committed to our principle of transparency and we will publish information regarding authority directives on this page.</p>

We entered Myanmar in 2013 with a clear ambition to support the country in its progress towards democracy and economic development. The recent events represent a set-back for the country’s path to reform. Access to telecom services is essential for people to exercise their basic right to freedom of opinion and expression, and to gain information. These services are also critical in the ongoing COVID-19 pandemic, and for economic opportunities. When following authority orders in these irregular times, we know it has negative impact on human rights in Myanmar. We are working to minimise this impact, and Telenor continues to emphasise to the authorities that access to telecom services should be maintained at all times.</p>\n<h2>Keeping the network open and adhering to our established process continues to be important</h2>\n<p>Keeping open communication lines for the people in Myanmar is important, and Telenor continues to follow its established global process for handling authority directives. Each directive is assessed for legal basis, human rights impact, necessity and proportionality and our ability to be transparent.</p>\n<p>As a local employer, Telenor Myanmar needs to handle a difficult situation and ensure the safety and security of employees on the ground during this state of emergency. Our ambition is to continue to take action, and to keep the local and global community informed. Telenor is deeply concerned with events in Myanmar and continues to assess the situation on ground.</p>\n<div class=""featurebox "">\n<h4>Nationwide network status* in Myanmar:</h4>\n<h2><span style=""color: #ff0000;"">Fixed/ Fixed Wireless and Enterprise services running as normal.

We continue to operate in an unpredictable situation in Myanmar and based on a holistic evaluation where we have to balance our principle of transparency with the safety of our employees, it is still not possible for Telenor to disclose the directives. We recognise the impact this has on the local and international community’s ability to receive information and we regret that this currently continues.

In that digital world, we play out our second life through carefully chosen and curated avatars, posting to social media, participating in online classrooms, and exploring the world one click, tap, swipe and browser window at a time.</p>\n<p>While it all sounds gloriously accessible, the virtual world has its barriers, and they are not insignificant. With data showing that South Asia – where I am from – faces one of the largest gender disparities in the connected world (women are 23% less likely to own a phone, and 51% less likely to connect to the mobile internet than men), the barrier to participation is high.</p>\n<p>Even where there is access and opportunities, the same technology that enables work play and learning can also bring about risks and harm to its citizens. Our ‘new normal’, as this Covid-19 life is often referred to, retains many of its original sins. On the internet, just like the real world, children and young people continue to be exposed to vulnerable situations, with females especially susceptible.</p>\n<h2><strong>The facts of the matter</strong></h2>\n<p>If you don’t believe me, believe the stats. A survey commissioned by Telenor’s mobile operator in Thailand, dtac, found that 91% of children had experienced online bullying, while a recent UNICEF study recorded an increase in cyberbullying in Malaysia despite higher awareness of the issue and more activities in place to combat this.</p>\n<p>Here’s other: a recent a one-week survey carried out by the Press Information Bureau among 1.6 million people showed that nearly 91% of female respondents feel unsafe in social media (Facebook), and nearly 53% of female respondents faced online harassment. More than 40% of respondents don’t know where and how to report online harassment. The danger here is two-fold: Firstly, the immediate impact on the individual’s emotional and mental health can be considerable, and secondly, if left unchecked in the longer term, the virtual environment becomes so insidious and unhealthy that it curtails online participation completely.</p>\n<h2><strong>What is the way forward?</strong></h2>\n<p>This is not an easy question to answer, but we need to start somewhere.</p>\n<p>Let’s begin with potential solutions. As a student of anthropology, I see research as a first step towards addressing the issue. Understanding what drives the behaviour of the transgressors and then those who experience the abuse is essential in crafting any robust response.</p>\n<p>Next stop, education. Let’s not forget that we don’t learn to be active, responsible citizens in the ‘real world’ by accident. Formal and informal structures such as our parents, grandparents, schools, culture guide us on how to behave and interact with our peers. In the virtual world, however, most of us are simply learning as we go; this doesn’t mean that appropriate social norms and behaviours from the ‘real world’ should change. Incorporating online safety education into school curriculum could begin to address this, yet one size will not fit all. Content customisation is essential so that modules targeted at children are not also served to older youths. Grameenphone’s “Be Smart Use Heart” programme is a tangible example of the potential of this approach and has already educated more than one million children in Bangladesh.</p>\n<p>Governments and technology players also have a large part to play in any effective progress. Laws and policies targeting online harassment and regulating online behaviour need to be put in place. Companies running the virtual world have a responsibility to come together to collectively implement policies for the responsible use of social media.</p>\n<h2><strong>A shared responsibility for a safer internet</strong></h2>\n<p>It should be clear by now that the responsibility to enable a safer online world does not fall squarely on the shoulders on any one group, but requires a collective effort from governments, civil society, businesses, and the individual. For now, may this article serve as a call-to-action to all related actors to work together to build a safer internet.</p>\n<p>****</p>\n<p><em>Reneka Ahmed Antu is a student, activist and </em><em>was part of a Girls Takeover initiative arranged by the Telenor/Plan global partnership on the International Day of the Girl last year.

Why bright is right for Pakistan’s solar energy evolution,,"<p>How has Telenor Pakistan managed to save 4.3 million litres of diesel and reduce their carbon emissions by 7.9 percent in under a year? The answer is right above our heads.  </p>

In Finland revenue and EBITDA are growing as a result of our customers’ demand for higher data speeds, including our new 5G offerings. In Asia, pressure on the top line remains due to intense competition and impact from the pandemic, in particular in Thailand and Malaysia. For the Group, subscription and traffic revenues decreased by 3 percent, however our flexibility to manage cost and investments levels resulted in stable EBITDA and improved cash flow.</p>\n<p>Entering 2021, we will maintain focus on our strategic priorities; growth, modernisation and responsible business. In the coming months, all our markets and especially our Asian subsidiaries will still be impacted by the spread of COVID-19 and government responsive measures. For the full year 2021, we expect organic subscription and traffic revenues and Ebitda to remain around 2020 level. We foresee a capex to sales ratio of 15-16% percent.

In some cases, too, it has impacted our behaviour and sparked unexpected debates. Privacy is just one of them, with the preponderance of track-and-trace apps heaving the topic into the glare of public discourse.</p>\n<h2>The stats have spoken</h2>\n<p>Even before this, Telenor Research’s 2019 <a href=""https://www.telenor.com/wp-content/uploads/2020/10/2020-SmartLife-Survey-Highlights-2.pdf"">SmartLife survey</a> had gone some way to asking just where users of mobile internet in Asia and the Nordics stand when it concerns privacy. Among the survey’s findings that may prove most provocative are the low rates of privacy knowledge in Asia.</p>\n<p><img alt="""" class=""alignnone size-desktop_content_full wp-image-61530"" height=""452"" src=""https://www.telenor.com/wp-content/uploads/2021/01/2020-SmartLife-Survey-Highlights-804x452.jpg"" width=""804"" /></p>\n<p>In Malaysia, a modest <em><strong>18 percent</strong></em>\xa0of respondents were seen as privacy knowledgeable; the number for Pakistani respondents was <em><strong>16 percent</strong></em>. These are stark numbers, especially when compared to Denmark’s <em><strong>55 percent</strong></em>. However, there is hope for both Asian countries. For the age group 18-36, the share of knowledgeable respondents has spiked since 2017 from <em><strong>7 to 15 percent</strong></em>\xa0in Malaysia and from <em><strong>1 to 14 percent </strong></em>in Pakistan.</p>\n<p>Even more encouragingly, and despite the knowledge gap, both Asian countries top their Nordic counterparts in taking actions to protect their privacy online (<em><strong>49 percent</strong></em>\xa0of Malaysians actively deactivate their locations, for example, with only<em><strong> 20 percent </strong></em>of Norwegians taking the same measures).</p>\n<p>With all of these insights into privacy behaviours, we called in two of our experts sitting in Islamabad and Oslo to make sense of the trends. Of course, we didn’t miss a chance to pick their brains for some practical tips that can help us keep control of our personal data.</p>\n<figure class=""wp-caption alignnone"" id=""attachment_61521"" style=""width: 804px;""><img alt="""" class=""wp-image-61521 size-desktop_content_full"" height=""536"" src=""https://www.telenor.com/wp-content/uploads/2021/01/D83B9707-804x536.jpg"" width=""804"" /><figcaption class=""wp-caption-text"" id=""caption-attachment-61521"">Kamal Ahmed, Chief Corporate Affairs Officer at Telenor Pakistan</figcaption></figure>\n<h3>The findings show there’s still a gap between the Nordic countries and Pakistan concerning privacy knowledge, BUT Pakistani mobile internet users are taking far more actions. How do you account for that?</h3>\n<p><strong>Kamal Ahmed, Chief Corporate Affairs Officer at Telenor Pakistan</strong><strong>:</strong> From the survey results, we can see that our customers in Pakistan are lagging when it comes to their privacy knowledge. Our ambition would be that the actions customers are taking are based on good customer knowledge. That’s where our role to educate and inform customers is paramount.</p>\n<p>Globally the importance and relevance of privacy are on the rise. Granted that as per the survey results, currently privacy-related knowledge is relatively low in Pakistan, this is not to say that this trend will continue in the future as well.\xa0 In fact, we believe that going forward privacy will become increasingly relevant for Pakistanis. Therefore, we have a window of opportunity to proactively take appropriate measures to handle our customers’ data in a responsible manner – something that we are actively pursuing at Telenor Pakistan.</p>\n<p>Currently, there is no specific data protection legislation in place in the country; however, the government is in the process of formulating one. Once this legislation is put in place, we expect to see a heightened awareness of privacy-related matters among the public, and also more stringent obligations on service providers to handle data and information in an appropriate and responsible manner. Our proactive approach towards ensuring that privacy is part of our organisational DNA will allow us to rise to the occasion when the legislation is put in place.</p>\n<figure class=""wp-caption alignnone"" id=""attachment_61523"" style=""width: 804px;""><img alt=""Ole Chr Berg Wasenden Senior Research Scientist at Telenor Research"" class=""wp-image-61523 size-desktop_content_full"" height=""536"" src=""https://www.telenor.com/wp-content/uploads/2021/01/Ole-Christian-Wasenden-4-804x536.jpg"" width=""804"" /><figcaption class=""wp-caption-text"" id=""caption-attachment-61523"">Ole Christian Berg Wasenden Senior Research Scientist at Telenor Research</figcaption></figure>\n<p><strong>Ole Christian Berg Wasenden, Senior Research Scientist at Telenor Research: </strong>It makes sense that Pakistani mobile internet users are still a bit behind those in the Nordic, privacy knowledge-wise. Nordic users have on average more internet experience and privacy was even a part of legislation and the public debate before the Internet giants accentuated the topic.</p>\n<p>However, it puzzles me that users in Pakistan take more actions to protect their personal data, especially since we also know that the privacy concern levels are higher in the Nordics. I think I will use the researcher’s standard answer: more research is needed. We still have a lot to learn about digital privacy preferences and behaviour.</p>\n<h3>It’s safe to say that focus by media and governments around GDPR has raised the awareness of privacy. What needs to happen in Asia to build privacy awareness among consumers?</h3>\n<p><strong>Kamal</strong><strong>: </strong>In Pakistan we’re looking forward to the Data Protection legislation as it offers the foundation for awareness, as seen in other countries. In the meantime, we continue to give privacy the attention it deserves, and the privacy our customers deserve as a right. Privacy has been part of our core values and there’s no changing that. We have and continue to educate our customers on privacy from the get-go.</p>\n<p>For example, we have provided a detailed privacy notice on our external website and ensure communication, which provides ample information to our customers regarding collection, processing and handling of personal data in our business. The privacy notice is further mapped at all existing data collection channels so our customers can educate themselves with respect to privacy.</p>\n<h3>Within the stats for privacy actions taken, we see that Asian respondents are far more likely to deactivate their location. This can be a challenge for Covid-19 tracing apps. Are there any other ways you feel the pandemic has impacted the privacy conversation globally?</h3>\n<p><strong>Kamal: </strong>Something we’ve seen in the case of cybersecurity is that awareness spikes when related cases hit the media. While legislation highlights issues that deserve awareness, the media offers them to the masses in a more relatable manner. For example, a hack or a breach of a major company is big news. Similarly, WhatsApp Privacy Policy 2021 prompted a lot of users to delete the app and switch to alternatives. Such media attention brings these topics to the wider public in a more tangible way. This combination helps create attention and awareness – this is where law meets comprehension.</p>\n<p>We could see the same with privacy as a result of COVID-19. If you consider the scale of discussion in media around the use of personal data in track-and-trace apps, and the willingness or lack thereof among some citizens globally to share that, I think we have a good example of privacy becoming a national or even global conversation. In many cases, that’s where <em>real </em>mass awareness begins.</p>\n<p><strong>Ole Christian:</strong>\xa0Yes, there has been a change. Traditionally the public privacy debate has had two main domains; on one hand it’s how large companies use, and perhaps misuse, data for commercial purposes. The second area is how the authorities can and should use personal data for surveillance. It is a new thought to most of us that our personal data can be a vital element in fighting a global pandemic.</p>\n<p>For many it’s an eye-opener that data can be used for a good cause, such as public health. And, I fully agree with Kamal, the discussions regarding track-and-trace apps will increase awareness and might additionally have effects on peoples’ behaviour also outside the “privacy for greater good” domain.</p>\n<h2><strong>Protect your privacy: Two practical measures you can take today</strong></h2>\n<p><strong>1 <em>Become more aware</em></strong>. Everyone can’t be expected to read every word of the terms and conditions for every service they use. However, seeking knowledge on how personal data are gathered and used when you’re online is becoming essential.</p>\n<p><strong>2 <em>Choose services wisely. </em></strong>There are plenty of privacy friendly services out there. Ole-Christian recommends the <em>Firefox</em> browser and the <em>duckduckgo</em> search engine.</p>\n<p>&nbsp;</p>\n<p>The post <a href=""https://www.telenor.com/more-privacy-please-are-consumers-in-asia-changing-their-approach-to-privacy/"" rel=""nofollow"">More privacy please: are consumers in Asia changing their approach to protecting their data?</a> appeared first on <a href=""https://www.telenor.com"" rel=""nofollow"">Telenor Group</a>.</p>'}","Wed, 27 Jan 2021 10:09:32 +0000",https://www.telenor.com/more-privacy-please-are-consumers-in-asia-changing-their-approach-to-privacy/,telecom

Top 10 signs that Norway’s Open AI Lab has lived up to expectations,,"<p>Four years ago, Telenor, NTNU and SINTEF came together to create what is today known as the Norwegian Open AI Lab. The idea was to build a ‘center of gravity’ in AI research and education in Norway. </p>

The founders believed that by joining forces, Norway could get a leg up in the AI race, igniting a more digital and more competitive Norwegian economy and, perhaps, even society-at-large. Like we said, big and bold.</p>\n<p>So, has the Norwegian Open AI Lab (NAIL) lived up to the expectations so far? It certainly did, and here are 10 reasons why.</p>\n<ol>\n<li><strong>If we build it, they will come. </strong>By year-end 2020, NAIL boasted 12 partners and a core team of 12 professors, more than 20 associate researchers and more than 75 PhD student in AI. Partners DNB, Equinor, Kongsberg Group and DNV joined in 2018, bringing more data, more real-life problems, and more funding from across Norwegian industries.</li>\n<li><strong>It started a trend</strong>. <a href=""https://www.telenor.com/media/press-release/a-strengthened-national-powerhouse-for-artificial-intelligence-in-norway"" rel=""noopener noreferrer"" target=""_blank"">Once the AI Lab was announced</a>, it sparked a chain reaction across Norway and more research and innovation communities popped up, such as CAIR (Center of Artificial Intelligence at University of Agder) and NORA (Norwegian Artificial Intelligence Research Consortium).

The team says that nearly every top minister has visited except the Prime one. But perhaps 2021 will be the year?</li>\n<li><strong>It’s ok to ask for directions</strong>. Even Norway did. Throughout 2018-2020, the centre contributed to the Norwegian national AI strategy by providing input, organising seminars, and engaging politicians and policymakers. NAIL pushed for greater investment in AI research and education and stronger collaboration across academia, industry, and government.</li>\n<li><strong>And the best master’s thesis award goes to</strong>… Every year since 2017, NAIL awards prizes to top-notch, cutting-edge AI students who are developing methods of high impact for Norwegian industry and society. Some carefully selected talents make the pitch, and the top three prizes are given with well-deserved accolades each year. What a recognition!</li>\n<li><strong>Speaking of students</strong> – more than 20 Master students can now say they’ve been able to complete their theses with guidance and support from Telenor Research. Topics covered included cyber threat detection, fake news classification, air quality forecasting and other burning issues for the world.</li>\n<li><strong>One thing leads to another</strong>.

This is a sport where accuracy isn’t just optimal, it’s essential.</p>\n<p>“Actually, the challenges a chatbot faces are quite similar to the ones that confront a fencer,” he continues.</p>\n<p>“Both need to gain a certain skill set to master unpredictable scenarios to accomplish their tasks successfully. Each person who contacts a chatbot wants the same thing. Not to land a hit, of course, but to get accurate information to solve an issue. And since there are countless ways people can present an issue, we have to train our chatbot, Telmi, how to respond to them.

From its first day of operations to the time of writing, the AI robot has handled more than one million customer inquiries.</p>\n<p>“It’s been a fascinating journey so far, and the number of Telmi users has steadily increased since we launched it,” says Lossius, adding that the chatbot processed more than 630,000 customer inquiries in 2020.</p>\n<p>“According to our estimates, this will increase by 10 percent in 2021, as we continue implementing Telmi in other Telenor Norway services. For 2023, our goal is for Telmi to process more than 770,000 customer inquiries.”</p>\n<p>The introduction of Telmi into new services requires a lot of calibrating and updating of the chatbot’s algorithm.</p>\n<p>“We constantly train Telmi to get better at recognising new words, meanings, questions, and to better interact with both our internal systems and with humans. Because, as I said earlier, humans are unpredictable.”</p>\n<p><a class=""bulletBlueChevron"" href=""https://www.telenor.com/lean-green-telco-machine-how-ai-is-greening-mobile-networks/"" rel=""noopener noreferrer"" target=""_blank"">This is how Telenor utilises AI technology in its networks to create a greener future.</a></p>\n<figure class=""wp-caption alignnone"" id=""attachment_61843"" style=""width: 2560px;""><img alt="""" class=""wp-image-61843 size-full"" height=""1707"" src=""https://www.telenor.com/wp-content/uploads/2021/02/Telmi-1-scaled.jpg"" width=""2560"" /><figcaption class=""wp-caption-text"" id=""caption-attachment-61843"">Preferred: Telmi is a text-based chatbot, which, according to Lossius, is the most popular use of speaking computers in the telecom sector today: “Text is much easier to recognise, understand, and interpret compared to speech.”</figcaption></figure>\n<h2>Robot fine-tuning</h2>\n<p>That unpredictability comes with layers of nuance, as we humans do not always say or write what we <em>actually </em>mean.</p>\n<p>“If a customer states ‘I would like to add more 4G to my phone’, it basically makes no sense. Humans, with the right knowledge, understand that the customer is actually referring to data, but it’s harder to teach a text-based machine to correctly interpret improper use of terms.”</p>\n<p>As providers continue to deliver new and ever more complex services to customers, the latter invent and adopt new ways of talking about them, explains Lossius.</p>\n<p>“It’s no wonder chatbots often struggle to find the answers customers are looking for. But with help from the research arm of Telenor, we’ve been able to fine-tune Telmi into serving customers more accurate information than ever before.”</p>\n<p><a class=""bulletBlueChevron"" href=""https://www.telenor.com/innovation/artificial-intelligence/"" rel=""noopener noreferrer"" target=""_blank"">Also read: Telenor&#8217;s goal in AI</a></p>\n<figure class=""wp-caption alignnone"" id=""attachment_61845"" style=""width: 2560px;""><img alt="""" class=""wp-image-61845 size-full"" height=""1707"" src=""https://www.telenor.com/wp-content/uploads/2021/02/AI-Trainer-1-scaled.jpg"" width=""2560"" /><figcaption class=""wp-caption-text"" id=""caption-attachment-61845"">Comprehensive: An increasing number of different customer related problems are directed to Telmi: “It needs to know about everything Telenor does, from PUK codes and invoices to fixed internet and coverage,” explains Olav Alexander Sell, Content Developer and AI Trainer at Telenor Norway.</figcaption></figure>\n<h2>More accurate each day</h2>\n<p>Some of Telmi’s increased accuracy stems from analyses of conversations between Telmi and customers. ‘Intents,’ as the chatbot professionals call it.</p>\n<p>“Every customer has an intention for contacting Telmi. Right now, Telmi can handle about 2,000 different predicted customer intents. For Telmi, an intent is, easily explained, a code. What you and I write in the chatbot log translates into codes, which tell the chatbot’s algorithm what sort of information it needs to provide,” explains Eleonora Freddi, Senior Research Scientist at Telenor Research.</p>\n<p>During spring 2020, the Telmi team gathered data from 150,000 conversations, which they handed to Freddi and her colleagues in Telenor Research. The result from the enormous material analysis has proved itself hugely valuable.</p>\n<p><a class=""bulletBlueChevron"" href=""https://www.telenor.com/how-our-mobility-data-can-help-predict-and-prevent-the-spread-of-covid-19/"">Telenor Research also supports the Norwegian government in combating the Covid-19 pandemic.

Eilertsen, Hilde Østvold, Monica Loftsgård.</figcaption></figure>\n<h2>Increased customer satisfaction</h2>\n<p>“From our analysis, we found that one percent of the intents accounted for 34 percent of all the conversations. This was a very important finding. It told us that improving only 27 of Telmi’s interpretation could potentially improve a third of all interactions between Telmi and customers,” Freddi tells us.</p>\n<p>Based on the results, the AI trainers implemented changes to the chatbot. They have since seen a significant difference in measured customer satisfaction. However, providing more accurate information won’t necessarily boost every customer’s satisfaction.</p>\n<p>“A customer’s satisfaction is mostly dependent on whether the issue was solved or not, which is very understandable. A chatbot can’t fix all problems, for instance, network coverage issues. So, even though the correct information is provided, the customer may be frustrated because the issue isn’t solved. Because of this, the customer may rate the chatbot as non-helpful. In general, it’s a challenging exercise to measure customers’ chatbot satisfaction,” says Freddi, adding that she and her colleagues are currently analysing a new set of data from Telmi conversations.</p>\n<p>Despite the potential for improvement, today’s chatbots have come a long way compared to where it all started, says one of the legends within the AI research field in Norway.</p>\n<p><a class=""bulletBlueChevron"" href=""https://www.telenor.com/telenor-sets-a-good-example-on-ai-upskilling/"" rel=""noopener noreferrer"" target=""_blank"">Interested in Artificial Intelligence?

Still, our vision is that Telmi one day will be able to solve every issue for customers in a satisfying way.”</figcaption></figure>\n<h2>The &#8216;friendly computer&#8217;</h2>\n<p>“In the 90s, we envisioned the friendly computer. A machine that spoke to humans in a ‘human’ way. It was merely a fantasy at that time, but today people are getting used to speaking to computers and virtual assistants,” says Telenor Research’s Knut Kvale, who started working with speech-based services in Telenor back in 1994.</p>\n<p>The senior research scientist points to the chatbot’s ability to fill a growing customer need as the reason for its increasing success.</p>\n<p>“Internal statistics show that about 50 percent of customers have visited our web page before calling our customer service desk. That’s a clear indication that we as customers are trying to find solutions by ourselves. Therefore, it can be beneficial for us to get help along the way from a friendly computer,” he says, stating that we should expect to be acquainted with a rising number of helpful machines in the future.</p>\n<p><a class=""bulletBlueChevron"" href=""https://www.telenor.com/media/announcement/new-norwegian-ai-centre-ready-to-shape-the-future"" rel=""noopener noreferrer"" target=""_blank"">This new Norwegian AI centre is ready to shape the future</a></p>\n<figure class=""wp-caption alignnone"" id=""attachment_61858"" style=""width: 2560px;""><img alt="""" class=""wp-image-61858 size-full"" height=""1707"" src=""https://www.telenor.com/wp-content/uploads/2021/02/Knut-2-scaled.jpg"" width=""2560"" /><figcaption class=""wp-caption-text"" id=""caption-attachment-61858"">Mr. chatbot: Knut Kvale has worked with speech technology since the late 1980s. He holds a degree in civil engineering from the Norwegian University of Science and Technology.</figcaption></figure>\n<h2>A chatbot breakthrough on the horizon?</h2>\n<p>“I believe we are standing on the doorstep of a huge chatbot breakthrough. Because, in addition to chatbots’ ability to serve customers at a fast pace, they provide a form of anonymity. People are rather uncomfortable with discussing certain topics with other humans. Therefore, I expect we’ll see a future increase in the implementation of chatbots in sectors such as health, finance, and local and regional government, to name a few.”</p>\n<p>Kvale hopes that the more we interact with chatbots, the better the quality of each conversation will become.</p>\n<p>“All communication must be adjusted based on who the recipient is. We usually need to communicate differently with a five-year-old than with an adult. The same applies when we’re communicating with machines. In most cases they only need the key information spelled correctly to serve you in the best possible way. What I’m saying is that we humans need to adapt a little to the chatbots as well to get the best experience possible. Because, as we all know, it takes two to tango.”</p>\n<p><a class=""bulletBlueChevron"" href=""https://www.telenor.com/innovation/stories"" rel=""noopener noreferrer"" target=""_blank"">Hungry for more insight?

In recent days, we have sought to adapt our operations to ensure the safety of our employees and the provision of essential services to the Myanmar people – whether food and drink, electricity, telecommunications, financial services or manufacturing &#8211; while respecting the individual rights to freedom of expression of our employees and the people of Myanmar.</p>\n<p>As investors, we inhabit a ‘shared space’ with the people of Myanmar, including civil society organisations, in which we all benefit from respect for human rights, democracy and fundamental freedoms – including freedom of expression and association &#8211; and the rule of law. The rule of law, respect for human rights, and the unrestricted flow of information all contribute to a stable business environment.</p>\n<p>We have always sought to operate in Myanmar transparently, and in line with core ILO Conventions and the UN Guiding Principles on Business and Human Rights. This includes undertaking ongoing human rights and wider business integrity due diligence, and complying with applicable sanctions, as well as the US Foreign Corrupt Practices Act (FCPA), the UK Anti-Bribery Act and Myanmar anti-bribery laws.</p>\n<p>We will also continue to work hand in hand with local business partners which share the same approach. We believe our business presence, practices, and advocacy for a level playing field for all businesses, and our commitment to international human rights standards contribute in a significant way to the journey of openness and democracy in Myanmar.</p>\n<p>We remain committed to our employees and to the people of Myanmar.

The amendments have passed without due process, and our previous concerns on these chapters remains.</p>\n<p>Furthermore, other amendments have been made to existing laws in Myanmar. Parts of the Law Protecting Privacy and Security of Citizens were suspended, and changes were made to the Penal Code and Criminal Procedural Code, resulting in a weakening of rule of law.</p>\n<p>As a corporate citizen, we are concerned that the amendments collectively broaden the powers awarded to the military authorities and reduce protection of civil liberties and human rights in the country. This is combined with lack of checks and balances from government, civil service and judiciary.

Thus, there is good reason to question both the lack of due process as well as proportionality of introduced penalties.</p>\n<p>Telenor Group calls for reinstatement of civil liberties and human rights protection and restoration of a sound legal framework in Myanmar with proportionality and proper checks and balances.</p>\n<h2>Telenor Group’s response to proposed Myanmar Cyber Security Bill</h2>\n<p><strong>15 February 2021:</strong> In response to the authorities’ request for consultation, Telenor Group has raised several issues. Telenor Group is of the strong opinion that the Cyber Security Bill should not be passed as proposed.</p>\n<p>The current, very short and limited, consultation has not allowed for the required dialogue on the proposed Cyber Security Bill. Given the broad scope of the proposed Bill and extensive powers that could significantly impact many, the proposed Bill should be properly consulted with a broad range of affected stakeholders (allowing public debate) and debated in Parliament to ensure that the law is fit for purpose and in line with the Constitution of Myanmar.</p>\n<p>Telenor’s entry into Myanmar in 2013/14 was premised on binding commitments from the Myanmar authorities in relation to key regulations and laws that would update Myanmar’s telecom regulatory framework in line with international best practice, including respecting fundamental rights.\xa0 This includes enacting an independent telecommunications regulator and putting in place a sound Lawful Intercept framework. We refer to our previous dialogue with the Ministry of Transport and Communications and the Post and Telecommunications Department setting forth our comments and suggestions to this effect.\xa0 We are concerned that the proposed Bill does not progress relevant regulatory frameworks and law for a digital future, nor promotes and safeguards digital safety and rights.</p>\n<p>Further, Myanmar has international obligations in relation to international agreements, treaties and international human rights law.\xa0 These obligations include respect for rule of law and good governance, and respect for the protection of human rights and fundamental freedoms.</p>\n<p>To this end, Telenor Group outlines four key principles in relation to the proposed Bill.\xa0 We strongly object to the passing of the proposed Bill without addressing the concerns below:</p>\n<ul>\n<li><strong>Human rights considerations:</strong> The proposed Bill must give due consideration to fundamental human rights such as freedom of speech and expression in Myanmar and personal privacy and security concerns to people in Myanmar.</li>\n<li><strong>Applicability of the proposed Bill:</strong> Passing the proposed Bill during a state of emergency and granting such broad powers to a temporary administration is not appropriate.</li>\n<li><strong>Execution of powers:</strong> There must be transparency, legal certainty, due process and clear criteria for the exercise of powers and interventions, independent administration and independent oversight under the proposed Bill.</li>\n<li><strong>Scope of proposed Bill:</strong> The proposed Bill should not include powers which can be used to order Lawful Interception, which is covered by the Telecom Law. Further, laws governing personal data protection, electronic transactions and cyber security should be kept separate to allow for more comprehensive protection, governance and execution across all areas.</li>\n</ul>\n<p>The post <a href=""https://www.telenor.com/media/press-release/telenor-groups-response-to-proposed-myanmar-cyber-security-bill"" rel=""nofollow"">Telenor Group’s response to proposed Myanmar Cyber Security Bill (Updated 8.3.2021)</a> appeared first on <a href=""https://www.telenor.com"" rel=""nofollow"">Telenor Group</a>.</p>'}","Mon, 15 Feb 2021 18:12:10 +0000",https://www.telenor.com/media/press-release/telenor-groups-response-to-proposed-myanmar-cyber-security-bill,telecom
Directives from authorities in Myanmar – February-March 2021,,"<p>On Monday 1 February, a state of emergency was declared under military leadership in Myanmar. The situation in Myanmar is irregular and uncertain, and the authorities are establishing procedures for issuing directives towards operators. Telenor handles these according to its defined processes for authority directives. At Telenor we remain committed to our principle of transparency and we will publish information regarding authority directives on this page.</p>

We entered Myanmar in 2013 with a clear ambition to support the country in its progress towards democracy and economic development. The recent events represent a set-back for the country’s path to reform. Access to telecom services is essential for people to exercise their basic right to freedom of opinion and expression, and to gain information. These services are also critical in the ongoing COVID-19 pandemic, and for economic opportunities. When following authority orders in these irregular times, we know it has negative impact on human rights in Myanmar. We are working to minimise this impact, and Telenor continues to emphasise to the authorities that access to telecom services should be maintained at all times.</p>\n<h2>Keeping the network open and adhering to our established process continues to be important</h2>\n<p>Keeping open communication lines for the people in Myanmar is important, and Telenor continues to follow its established global process for handling authority directives. Each directive is assessed for legal basis, human rights impact, necessity and proportionality and our ability to be transparent.</p>\n<p>As a local employer, Telenor Myanmar needs to handle a difficult situation and ensure the safety and security of employees on the ground during this state of emergency. Our ambition is to continue to take action, and to keep the local and global community informed. Telenor is deeply concerned with events in Myanmar and continues to assess the situation on ground.</p>\n<div class=""featurebox "">\n<h4>Nationwide network status* in Myanmar:</h4>\n<h2><span style=""color: #ff0000;"">Fixed/ Fixed Wireless and Enterprise services running as normal.

We recognise the impact this has on the local and international community’s ability to receive information and we regret that this currently continues.

A Young Woman’s Perspective on What Makes A Safer Internet,,"<p>The internet is so important for young people to stay connected and engaged. However, issues around internet safety, including online abuse primarily directed at women, remain a barrier to equal access in some parts of the world. On Safer Internet day, 21-year-old student and activist, Reneka Ahmed Antu from Bangladesh, reflects on the path forward for a safer and better online experience for all. </p>

As we bear witness, so too do we begin to inhabit two worlds: the physical and the virtual. With our physical world curtailed by the global pandemic, we find ourselves becoming increasingly virtual citizens. In that digital world, we play out our second life through carefully chosen and curated avatars, posting to social media, participating in online classrooms, and exploring the world one click, tap, swipe and browser window at a time.</p>\n<p>While it all sounds gloriously accessible, the virtual world has its barriers, and they are not insignificant. With data showing that South Asia – where I am from – faces one of the largest gender disparities in the connected world (women are 23% less likely to own a phone, and 51% less likely to connect to the mobile internet than men), the barrier to participation is high.</p>\n<p>Even where there is access and opportunities, the same technology that enables work play and learning can also bring about risks and harm to its citizens. Our ‘new normal’, as this Covid-19 life is often referred to, retains many of its original sins. On the internet, just like the real world, children and young people continue to be exposed to vulnerable situations, with females especially susceptible.</p>\n<h2><strong>The facts of the matter</strong></h2>\n<p>If you don’t believe me, believe the stats. A survey commissioned by Telenor’s mobile operator in Thailand, dtac, found that 91% of children had experienced online bullying, while a recent UNICEF study recorded an increase in cyberbullying in Malaysia despite higher awareness of the issue and more activities in place to combat this.</p>\n<p>Here’s other: a recent a one-week survey carried out by the Press Information Bureau among 1.6 million people showed that nearly 91% of female respondents feel unsafe in social media (Facebook), and nearly 53% of female respondents faced online harassment. More than 40% of respondents don’t know where and how to report online harassment. The danger here is two-fold: Firstly, the immediate impact on the individual’s emotional and mental health can be considerable, and secondly, if left unchecked in the longer term, the virtual environment becomes so insidious and unhealthy that it curtails online participation completely.</p>\n<h2><strong>What is the way forward?</strong></h2>\n<p>This is not an easy question to answer, but we need to start somewhere.</p>\n<p>Let’s begin with potential solutions. As a student of anthropology, I see research as a first step towards addressing the issue. Understanding what drives the behaviour of the transgressors and then those who experience the abuse is essential in crafting any robust response.</p>\n<p>Next stop, education. Let’s not forget that we don’t learn to be active, responsible citizens in the ‘real world’ by accident. Formal and informal structures such as our parents, grandparents, schools, culture guide us on how to behave and interact with our peers. In the virtual world, however, most of us are simply learning as we go; this doesn’t mean that appropriate social norms and behaviours from the ‘real world’ should change. Incorporating online safety education into school curriculum could begin to address this, yet one size will not fit all. Content customisation is essential so that modules targeted at children are not also served to older youths. Grameenphone’s “Be Smart Use Heart” programme is a tangible example of the potential of this approach and has already educated more than one million children in Bangladesh.</p>\n<p>Governments and technology players also have a large part to play in any effective progress. Laws and policies targeting online harassment and regulating online behaviour need to be put in place. Companies running the virtual world have a responsibility to come together to collectively implement policies for the responsible use of social media.</p>\n<h2><strong>A shared responsibility for a safer internet</strong></h2>\n<p>It should be clear by now that the responsibility to enable a safer online world does not fall squarely on the shoulders on any one group, but requires a collective effort from governments, civil society, businesses, and the individual. For now, may this article serve as a call-to-action to all related actors to work together to build a safer internet.</p>\n<p>****</p>\n<p><em>Reneka Ahmed Antu is a student, activist and </em><em>was part of a Girls Takeover initiative arranged by the Telenor/Plan global partnership on the International Day of the Girl last year.

Why bright is right for Pakistan’s solar energy evolution,,"<p>How has Telenor Pakistan managed to save 4.3 million litres of diesel and reduce their carbon emissions by 7.9 percent in under a year? The answer is right above our heads.  </p>

In contrast, and for context, Telenor’s home market of Norway experiences on average approximately 1,700.</p>\n<p>As you can probably imagine, 3,000 hours of annual sunshine is the sort of stat that has solar energy enthusiasts rubbing their hands in excitement, largely because it represents viable potential to do one very important thing: transition energy sources from fossil fuels to\u202fviable\u202frenewable solutions.</p>\n<h2><strong>A Thunderbolt from the blue</strong></h2>\n<p>Whisper it: modernisation can sometimes be a big, corporate word and what it\u202freally\u202fmeans can to be hard to pin down. Ultimately, though, it’s about progress; about doing things better (ideally),\u202fand\u202fusing new tools, techniques and knowledge\u202fto do them.</p>\n<p>Project Thunderbolt – a joint energy optimisation initiative initiated by Telenor’s Asia businesses – marks Telenor Pakistan’s transition\u202ffrom fossil fuels to renewable energies to power their network. It’s one of those rare tangible examples of\u202fmodernisation, aiming as it does to apply new thinking, new techniques, and new technologies to make something work better. Oh yeah, and it also stands to have a positive\u202fimpact on\u202fTelenor’s emissions in the countries where it operates. <img alt="""" class=""alignright wp-image-61607 size-thumbnail"" height=""147"" src=""https://www.telenor.com/wp-content/uploads/2021/02/Thunderbolt-293x147.jpg"" width=""293"" /></p>\n<p>“I can honestly say that, as a company,\u202fwe’ve always believed\u202fthat doing good is\u202fgood\u202fbusiness”,\u202fsays Sohaib Tariq, Team Lead for the project in Pakistan.\u202f“Actually\u202fwe’ve\u202falways had a real interest in renewable energy\u202fsince we started working with it in 2011.\u202fKnowing that the transition would be complex was never going to stop us, either,\u202fbecause we knew that the change represented a\u202fbenefit to the environment, the potential to address the grid crisis, AND the chance to provide better connectivity to our customers.”</p>\n<h2><strong>Timing is\u202feverything</strong></h2>\n<p>It would be nice to have timing on your side when you&#8217;re kicking-off an\u202findustry-first energy transition project.

How do you account for that?</h3>\n<p><strong>Kamal Ahmed, Chief Corporate Affairs Officer at Telenor Pakistan</strong><strong>:</strong> From the survey results, we can see that our customers in Pakistan are lagging when it comes to their privacy knowledge. Our ambition would be that the actions customers are taking are based on good customer knowledge. That’s where our role to educate and inform customers is paramount.</p>\n<p>Globally the importance and relevance of privacy are on the rise. Granted that as per the survey results, currently privacy-related knowledge is relatively low in Pakistan, this is not to say that this trend will continue in the future as well.\xa0 In fact, we believe that going forward privacy will become increasingly relevant for Pakistanis. Therefore, we have a window of opportunity to proactively take appropriate measures to handle our customers’ data in a responsible manner – something that we are actively pursuing at Telenor Pakistan.</p>\n<p>Currently, there is no specific data protection legislation in place in the country; however, the government is in the process of formulating one. Once this legislation is put in place, we expect to see a heightened awareness of privacy-related matters among the public, and also more stringent obligations on service providers to handle data and information in an appropriate and responsible manner. Our proactive approach towards ensuring that privacy is part of our organisational DNA will allow us to rise to the occasion when the legislation is put in place.</p>\n<figure class=""wp-caption alignnone"" id=""attachment_61523"" style=""width: 804px;""><img alt=""Ole Chr Berg Wasenden Senior Research Scientist at Telenor Research"" class=""wp-image-61523 size-desktop_content_full"" height=""536"" src=""https://www.telenor.com/wp-content/uploads/2021/01/Ole-Christian-Wasenden-4-804x536.jpg"" width=""804"" /><figcaption class=""wp-caption-text"" id=""caption-attachment-61523"">Ole Christian Berg Wasenden Senior Research Scientist at Telenor Research</figcaption></figure>\n<p><strong>Ole Christian Berg Wasenden, Senior Research Scientist at Telenor Research: </strong>It makes sense that Pakistani mobile internet users are still a bit behind those in the Nordic, privacy knowledge-wise. Nordic users have on average more internet experience and privacy was even a part of legislation and the public debate before the Internet giants accentuated the topic.</p>\n<p>However, it puzzles me that users in Pakistan take more actions to protect their personal data, especially since we also know that the privacy concern levels are higher in the Nordics. I think I will use the researcher’s standard answer: more research is needed. We still have a lot to learn about digital privacy preferences and behaviour.</p>\n<h3>It’s safe to say that focus by media and governments around GDPR has raised the awareness of privacy. What needs to happen in Asia to build privacy awareness among consumers?</h3>\n<p><strong>Kamal</strong><strong>: </strong>In Pakistan we’re looking forward to the Data Protection legislation as it offers the foundation for awareness, as seen in other countries. In the meantime, we continue to give privacy the attention it deserves, and the privacy our customers deserve as a right. Privacy has been part of our core values and there’s no changing that. We have and continue to educate our customers on privacy from the get-go.</p>\n<p>For example, we have provided a detailed privacy notice on our external website and ensure communication, which provides ample information to our customers regarding collection, processing and handling of personal data in our business. The privacy notice is further mapped at all existing data collection channels so our customers can educate themselves with respect to privacy.</p>\n<h3>Within the stats for privacy actions taken, we see that Asian respondents are far more likely to deactivate their location. This can be a challenge for Covid-19 tracing apps. Are there any other ways you feel the pandemic has impacted the privacy conversation globally?</h3>\n<p><strong>Kamal: </strong>Something we’ve seen in the case of cybersecurity is that awareness spikes when related cases hit the media. While legislation highlights issues that deserve awareness, the media offers them to the masses in a more relatable manner. For example, a hack or a breach of a major company is big news. Similarly, WhatsApp Privacy Policy 2021 prompted a lot of users to delete the app and switch to alternatives. Such media attention brings these topics to the wider public in a more tangible way. This combination helps create attention and awareness – this is where law meets comprehension.</p>\n<p>We could see the same with privacy as a result of COVID-19. If you consider the scale of discussion in media around the use of personal data in track-and-trace apps, and the willingness or lack thereof among some citizens globally to share that, I think we have a good example of privacy becoming a national or even global conversation. In many cases, that’s where <em>real </em>mass awareness begins.</p>\n<p><strong>Ole Christian:</strong>\xa0Yes, there has been a change. Traditionally the public privacy debate has had two main domains; on one hand it’s how large companies use, and perhaps misuse, data for commercial purposes. The second area is how the authorities can and should use personal data for surveillance. It is a new thought to most of us that our personal data can be a vital element in fighting a global pandemic.</p>\n<p>For many it’s an eye-opener that data can be used for a good cause, such as public health. And, I fully agree with Kamal, the discussions regarding track-and-trace apps will increase awareness and might additionally have effects on peoples’ behaviour also outside the “privacy for greater good” domain.</p>\n<h2><strong>Protect your privacy: Two practical measures you can take today</strong></h2>\n<p><strong>1 <em>Become more aware</em></strong>. Everyone can’t be expected to read every word of the terms and conditions for every service they use. However, seeking knowledge on how personal data are gathered and used when you’re online is becoming essential.</p>\n<p><strong>2 <em>Choose services wisely. </em></strong>There are plenty of privacy friendly services out there. Ole-Christian recommends the <em>Firefox</em> browser and the <em>duckduckgo</em> search engine.</p>\n<p>&nbsp;</p>\n<p>The post <a href=""https://www.telenor.com/more-privacy-please-are-consumers-in-asia-changing-their-approach-to-privacy/"" rel=""nofollow"">More privacy please: are consumers in Asia changing their approach to protecting their data?</a> appeared first on <a href=""https://www.telenor.com"" rel=""nofollow"">Telenor Group</a>.</p>'}","Wed, 27 Jan 2021 10:09:32 +0000",https://www.telenor.com/more-privacy-please-are-consumers-in-asia-changing-their-approach-to-privacy/,telecom
